On Thursday 21st May he was hit from behind  by a reversing delivery van whilst taking a stroll in his quiet cul-de-sac in the retirement village where he lives.

Providing drivers with adequate parking areas prevents conflict with those who disapprove of this vital industry, protects the welfare of the driver and improves road safety and the safety of the vehicle. It will encourage new blood to the industry.\",\n",

I think the prison sentences and punishments for crimes like these as too soft and more needs to be done in terms of deterring this sort of crime.\\nAdditional Details: We need to set an example. Child trafficking and child abuse goes on more than we think and we need to do more. The prison sentences abusers get is nothing compared to the lifelong trauma they inflict on their victims. I would like more funding to go to charities that help the victims of sexual abuse however I don’t think it’s enough. We need to set a standard. We need to protect our children and ourselves.

Data about minority groups is vital because underreporting could allow discrimination to go unnoticed. We ask the ONS to include a separate tick box in the next UK census in 2021 and to change the question as the same in Scotland and Northern Ireland to ‘What religion, religious denomination or body do you belong to?’.',\n",

Surely we are paying for some of the services twice? How is this fair or legal? If the council aren't responsible for the upkeep of the area then surely the home owner and the landlords in that area should get a reduction in council tax fees.\",\n",

Patients can be unable to get food, drink, medication, see visitors or doctors without passing through or using mixed-sex areas.\\n\\nBathrooms and dormitories are single sex but staff are not always present; sexual assaults are not uncommon on mixed-sex wards. \\nAdditional Details: Mixed-sex wards can feel as if they lack privacy and at times can feel unsafe. Some patients have a history of abuse and trauma and need a single-sex environment to heal. The Government should require the NHS provide single-sex psychiatric wards so that this is possible.',\n",

It will be up to the larger vehicle to prove that it was not their fault.\\nAdditional Details: For the sake of the environment, the nation's health, to alleviate the burden on the NHS and for the sake of our economy we need to encourage more people to get on their bikes and to walk. By introducing legislation whereby the larger vehicle is presumed to be at fault in the event of an incident, drivers should be more inclined to show greater respect for other road users.\",\n",
       " 'Many ELT schools are excluded from the business rates relief scheme for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses, despite providing educational holidays for 550,000 overseas visitors a year. Schools closed their doors as part of the national effort to keep people safe but now face financial ruin.\\nAdditional Details: The Chancellor announced that all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England - those most impacted by Covid-19 - would benefit from a business rates holiday for the next 12 months. However, due to some unclear guidance from the Ministry of Communities, Housing & Local Government, many English language schools are being deemed as ineligible by local authorities. Without this relief, many schools will be lost along with the jobs that they support and other benefits they bring to the UK.',\n",
       " 'The police complaints system is overly complex. Police have unlimited time to investigate and respond to serious issues and take action. 28 days to fully respond to all complaints is achievable and would give the general public reassurance, instead of potentially having to wait years for a response.\\nAdditional Details: People should be able to complain against police forces and receive a timely response, which should support continuous improvement by police forces. Assaults and mistreatment by police officers should be effectively responded to and dealt with as expeditiously as possible. I myself complained about being assaulted by the police and had to wait 3 years for video evidence of this police assault. This needs to change for everybody.',\n",

If not recorded by 1st January 2026, they will be closed and lost forever. The legal process for recording a path, often done by volunteers, is time consuming and may take several years.

I would like the government to give the BBL the requested 1 million pounds asked for by Sir Rodney Walker to survive the current situation.\\nAdditional Details: I would like the government to fulfil the basketball community’s request as basketball has been proven to be one of the most popular sports by participation. According to Statista, Rugby League had 62,000 participants playing it in the UK whereas Basketball had 280,000 participating in the UK. Rugby League was given 15 million pounds, basketball was given nothing. The loss of the league would be extremely detrimental to Basketball in the UK.',\n",
       " 'I would like women to be offered a smear test from the age of 16 in the UK instead of having to wait until you are 25.\\nAdditional Details: Many women have signs of cervical cancer but are not offered a smear test until they are 25 years old. I believe you should be offered a smear test from the age of 16 as this is when you are legally allowed to be sexually active.',\n",
       " 'Dementia effects all ages, but many hospitals do not have specialised facilities to meet the needs of people with dementia and their carers. The Government should fund dedicated dementia wards in all hospitals, to provide advice, right environment, targeted medical treatment & comfort.\\nAdditional Details: Dedicated wards would consist of nurses, doctors & other specialists who would be able to give the right treatment & assistance, in discussion with patients and carers. We believe the benefits of improving specialised care would far outweigh the costs.',\n",
       " \"We petition the Government to revoke its support for large-scale nuclear power projects. They would be counter-productive to the UK's economic recovery, its climate targets and future national security.\\nAdditional Details: Large nuclear projects are now too costly, however funded; too slow to construct, too fraught with technical obstacles and too controversial if run by overseas developers. Rather than contributing to a sustainable Green Recovery I worry they are draining funding, time and government attention from solutions that are much more deliverable and cost-effective.\",\n",

By the time students go back to normal learning, 6 months will have passed since schools were closed to most pupils. This has already had a huge impact on the studying of so many.\\nAdditional Details: Students in the UK have already missed hundreds of hours of learning since 23rd March. This has had a huge effect. Some pupils don’t have the essential resources: a working computer, textbooks, stationary, etc. Many don’t have a proper learning environment, therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true efforts of pupils. Hence why I am writing to the Government to cancel GCSEs and A Levels and provide predicted grades to show the true reflections of students across the country.',\n",
       " 'Update the guidance sent to local councils so that it includes ‘event hire’ and ‘exhibition’ companies. \\n\\nThis will allow councils to pay these companies the grants and reduced business rates that they have been promised by the Chancellor.\\nAdditional Details: The Chancellor said in the House of Commons that event hire & exhibition companies fell under the umbrella of leisure & hospitality and as such would qualify for the Retail, Leisure & Hospitality Grant. \\n\\nThe guidance sent to local councils does not include them, and as such, they are being refused the support promised. \\n\\nCouncils need the guidance to be updated in order to support an industry devastated by Covid-19.

Now the median life expectancy for those living with cystic fibrosis is 37. This lack of an exemption needs to be revised.\\nAdditional Details: Many people in the UK with cystic fibrosis have to pay prescription charges. I feel this is so wrong when a lot of others are exempt yet some with cystic fibrosis are expected to pay. Some people with CF have to take up to 11 different types of tablets a day, without antibiotics. Why should they be made to pay for prescriptions? We need to make this change. It’s hard enough living with cystic fibrosis, let alone having to find the money to pay for all prescriptions or a yearly payment.',\n",

MDWs are already at a greater risk of experiencing forced labour and abuse, which only increases among those that are undocumented. The ability to renew the visa with a route to settlement will enable MDWs to seek support if their employer is abusive, and will enable them to continue to contribute to society.\",\n",
       " \"As our representatives, I want the government to ensure that any agreements made do not undermine the UK's food production and welfare standards. If it would be illegal to produce and sell in the UK, it should be illegal to import it.\\nAdditional Details: I do not agree that the vote on the Agricultural Bill was an accurate representation of the public's view; it would not be right to sell food in the UK that would be illegal to produce in the UK. I want all food that is sold in the UK to be from farms that have a minimum production and welfare standard. It is undeniable that the UK has some of the highest welfare standards in the world, this is because of years of campaigns, petitions and manifestos (including yours); this shouldn't be subverted\",\n",
       " 'I would like a public vote/referendum on whether we want to spend in excess of £100 billion on a train project which will destroy or irreparably damage natural habitats and wildlife sites along the route.\\nAdditional Details: To me, the damage & cost to public land, wildlife & nature at a time of Environmental emergency & recession outweighs the long-term benefits of travel. The HS2 project should be decided by the people paying for it, the tax payers. It’s destroying communities & environment.',\n",

It should also look at how those posting content from other countries, or on sites hosted in other countries but available in the UK, can be prosecuted and brought to justice. \\nAdditional Details: My 21 month old grandson was killed in 2013 and was targeted by a US website. He was called horrific racist names and his death mocked because he was black. The Government should do all it can to stop this abhorrent material.',\n",

These people are stuck in limbo and need urgent support.\\n\\nCan the government look into this immediately and provide resources for research for the thousands of citizens stuck with the long term effects of C-19, and the publication and promotion of advice and support.  \\n\",\n",
       " 'These collars are designed to control dogs by inflicting pain. There are many painless alternatives which makes this practice outdated. Please ban choke and pronged collars because their use can cause harm and is cruel and unnecessary punishment.\\nAdditional Details: Choke and pronged collars can cause physical and emotional damage. Whiplash, puncturing the skin, spinal cord injuries and crushing the trachea are some examples. A dog, like a child, is totally dependent on it’s owner and their choices. Choosing to hurt the dog to correct it when there are other options must be considered inhumane. Please consider if, what amounts to torture of a dog, is acceptable in our society and should it be outlawed under the Animal Welfare Act',\n",

We want an independent public inquiry into Grooming Gangs.\\nAdditional Details: Last year we learned 57 young girls were thought to have been exploited by up to 100 members of a grooming gang. There is clear public concern, and appear to be failings by Police, Social Services, Local Authorities and the CPS to protect the most vulnerable.\\n\\nA public inquiry should answer: What happened?

Knowing you have to take medication for the rest of your life is tough, but that medication doesn’t come free, or cheap.\\nAdditional Details: A PPC costs £29.65 for 3 months or £105.90 for 12 months, which is cheaper than paying for individual prescriptions but isn’t enough, it should be free. Having these conditions also means having time off work or some may not be able to work at all. It's not fair that whilst earning less money or no money at all we still have to pay for medication. IBD patients should be medically exempt so they never have to worry about not being able to have access to crucial medications ever again.\",\n",

If other businesses are allowed to reopen, sports should not be discriminated against.\\nAdditional Details: The Government has allowed leisure businesses to reopen from 4th July with social distancing requirements in place. Providing sports clubs can comply with the same requirements they should be allowed to reopen with limited capacities to allow them access to sources of income. Large scale protests have recently been held without emergency services being overwhelmed indicating the country is ready to start reopening the economy.

This should be a mixture of small tunnels for small mammals, invertebrates and amphibians, large tunnels for deer and badgers, and culverts for aquatic/semi-aquatic life.\\nAdditional Details: Overground areas of HS2 pose a variety of threats to wildlife by blocking movement or causing direct mortality. Wildlife tunnels can mitigate these effects by connecting fragmented urban and rural habitat and reducing collisions - it has been extremely successful with other infrastructure projects across the world. Connectivity is vital for maintaining genetic diversity and allowing animals assess different territories, resources and mates; all vital for preventing further species decline.',\n",

This could be done by the deceased's legal next of kin representing the deceased with legal documentation at the registration.\\nAdditional Details: The law does not allow an unmarried mother to place the father's name on the child's birth certificate without them being present. When the father is deceased it is impossible to register them on the birth certificate without having to go through financial burdens, legal processes and added heartache.

Many families have been practicing Paganism for generations, it is a long misunderstood faith that centers its beliefs in the natural world and doing only good.

Some of these dogs can be provided by puppy mills and is easier than transporting puppies, which Lucy’s Law has prevented.

Appropriate justice is a life sentence for these crimes.\\nAdditional Details: Kristian's killer was convicted of causing death by 'Careless Driving' rather than 'Dangerous Driving' - a crime which carries a maximum sentence of just 5 years. 18 months in prison is not justice for killing someone and is unlikely to deter future drink-driving. The sentence does not fit the crime. The impact to the lives of the victim’s family is incomprehensible and a sentence of 18 months further damages the family.

Primary legislation does not include a power to prevent site owners from passing on annual or application fees to park home residents via the pitch fee. These costs should be borne by the industry  or by central government, where its predecessors failed to to ensure that rogue and criminal park owners were not afforded licenses and therefore facilitated their expansion.
