i want reversing cameras to be compulsory for all commercial vehicles on the road without a rear view  i am particularly concerned with the increased number of delivery drivers in residential areas without rear view vision  additional details  my 87 year old father has just recovered from covid 19 after 2 weeks in hospital  on thursday 21st may he was hit from behind  by a reversing delivery van whilst taking a stroll in his quiet cul de sac in the retirement village where he lives  as a result of this i am setting up a campaign to make reversing cameras compulsory on vans and lorries  surely we should no longer accept the if you cant see my wing mirrors i cant see you  signs on vehicles when the technology is easily available  we would like sia licenced security staff to be added to the assaults on emergency workers act 2018 additional details  as we have seen over the pandemic crisis  key workers are an essential part to our everyday lives  security staff  along with the police and ambulance and fire  help keep law and order  it is only right that the privileges that are afforded by this law is also offered out to sia licence security staff review planning legislation to force councils to include adequate safe and secure hgv parking with refreshment and washing facilities for drivers when allowing large distribution parks to be built  based on percentage capacity  or when undertaking major road improvement or construction works  additional details  hgv traffic is a direct indication on the health of a nations economy  providing drivers with adequate parking areas prevents conflict with those who disapprove of this vital industry  protects the welfare of the driver and improves road safety and the safety of the vehicle  it will encourage new blood to the industry sexual assault can have a devastating impact on children as they grow up and victims in general  this crime can change a persons life forever  i think the prison sentences and punishments for crimes like these as too soft and more needs to be done in terms of deterring this sort of crime  additional details  we need to set an example  child trafficking and child abuse goes on more than we think and we need to do more  the prison sentences abusers get is nothing compared to the lifelong trauma they inflict on their victims  i would like more funding to go to charities that help the victims of sexual abuse however i dont think its enough  we need to set a standard  we need to protect our children and ourselves  the people in charge need speak for the millions of people who feel this way psychiatric wards are often mixed sex  patients can be unable to get food  drink  medication  see visitors or doctors without passing through or using mixed sex areas   bathrooms and dormitories are single sex but staff are not always present  sexual assaults are not uncommon on mixed sex wards   additional details  mixed sex wards can feel as if they lack privacy and at times can feel unsafe  some patients have a history of abuse and trauma and need a single sex environment to heal  the government should require the nhs provide single sex psychiatric wards so that this is possible adopt a system whereby  in the event of an incident  the liability for the incident falls on the larger vehicle  it will be up to the larger vehicle to prove that it was not their fault  additional details  for the sake of the environment  the nations health  to alleviate the burden on the nhs and for the sake of our economy we need to encourage more people to get on their bikes and to walk  by introducing legislation whereby the larger vehicle is presumed to be at fault in the event of an incident  drivers should be more inclined to show greater respect for other road users the police complaints system is overly complex  police have unlimited time to investigate and respond to serious issues and take action  28 days to fully respond to all complaints is achievable and would give the general public reassurance  instead of potentially having to wait years for a response  additional details  people should be able to complain against police forces and receive a timely response  which should support continuous improvement by police forces  assaults and mistreatment by police officers should be effectively responded to and dealt with as expeditiously as possible  i myself complained about being assaulted by the police and had to wait 3 years for video evidence of this police assault  this needs to change for everybody the government should make it a criminal offence to use images of people without their consent to mock them online  it should also look at how those posting content from other countries  or on sites hosted in other countries but available in the uk  can be prosecuted and brought to justice   additional details  my 21 month old grandson was killed in 2013 and was targeted by a us website  he was called horrific racist names and his death mocked because he was black  the government should do all it can to stop this abhorrent material the home secretary said what happened to victims of child sexual exploitation gangs was “one of the biggest stains on our countrys conscience ” last year local authorities identified 18 700 suspected victims of child sexual exploitation  we want an independent public inquiry into grooming gangs  additional details  last year we learned 57 young girls were thought to have been exploited by up to 100 members of a grooming gang  there is clear public concern  and appear to be failings by police  social services  local authorities and the cps to protect the most vulnerable   a public inquiry should answer  what happened  who is to blame  what can be done to prevent this happening again  is there a racial religious element to this type of offending  how are survivors being supported and should more be done we want the uk government to     extend the law on coercive control  s 76 serious crime act 2015  to cover circumstances where a victim has left the relationship   to remove the defense under s 76 8  where a perp can claim they were acting in the victims best interest  additional details  s 76 serious crime act 2015 rightly recognises the horrific impact that coercive control has on victims of domestic abuse    however  it does not recognise that  for many victims  this abuse continues once they have left the abuser    stalking and harassment law doesnt provide effective coverage   which often leaves victims without protection    s 76 8  also gives the abuser an unnecessary defence   that they were acting in the victims best interest  they never are so this must be removed!tackle the rising far right and fascists in the uk by introducing legislation similar to the german strafgesetzbuch section 86a  making the use of nazi symbolism and nazi salutes illegal and punishable  additional details  scenes of nazi salutes under the shadow of war memorials must be tackled  thus far  it seems the police are left to resort to a public order offence and may not want to apply this post incident  for example  when video evidence is available   a specific offence would make this abhorrent behaviour much easier to prosecute and remove from our streets the government should introduce legislation to require people with knowledge or suspicions of child sexual abuse to report this to the authorities  and make it an offence punishable by fines or a custodial sentence to fail to report or cover up suspected abuse  or facilitate a perpetrator  additional details  i was sexually abused as a 13 year old and i am disgusted that many individuals and organisations assisted in keeping this quiet  new legislation could prevent this from happening again  and ensure that those who dont report suspected child abuse can be held accountable kristian johnson was killed by a drink driver who was more than twice the legal limit  his killer was sentenced to 3 years for causing death by careless driving and is eligible for release from prison in 18 months  we want appropriate justice  appropriate justice is a life sentence for these crimes  additional details  kristians killer was convicted of causing death by careless driving rather than dangerous driving   a crime which carries a maximum sentence of just 5 years  18 months in prison is not justice for killing someone and is unlikely to deter future drink driving  the sentence does not fit the crime  the impact to the lives of the victims family is incomprehensible and a sentence of 18 months further damages the family  kristian was 24  of good health and should have had a full life ahead of him  instead it was cut tragically short    we are asking the government to increase the maximum penalty to life sentences for death by careless driving as they promised in october 2017 and those convicted should serve a minimum of 15 years currently  only those that intend their victim to be distressed can be prosecuted  this excludes those that act for sexual gratification  financial gain  or to humiliate the victim  or those who are indifferent   distress and embarrassment regardless of intent must be included to fill this gap  additional details  the current legislation fails to protect those who have their intimate images shared without consent or knowledge because the intention was sexual and depraved as opposed to malice towards the individual  the criteria of the offence is half complete as consent is distinct but intentions are ambiguous  my private images were shared without consent during a seemingly trusting relationship  these were posted on indecent and pornographic websites to satisfy his sexual desire to degrade me online we live in unprecedented times and more than ever the public need to know that what is said in the house of commons is true and not an easily proved false statement  increasingly we are seeing untruths as a deflection tactic  lying in the house of commons should carry a prison sentence of 10 years additional details  the government should pass legislation to make the telling of demonstrable untruths in both the house of commons and house of lords a criminal offence for the first year  young drivers must have a black box fitted before they can drive  furthermore  they should only be able to carry one passenger  who must be an experienced driver  these changes should significantly decrease the amount of young road crash fatalities by encouraging safer driving  additional details  last year  i lost my best friend olivia alkir in a road crash  unfortunately  she was not the first or the last to face an early grave due to reckless and dangerous driving  which is far too common among young drivers  in 2018  777 car occupants were killed in road collisions  308 of whom  40 percent  died in collisions involving a driver aged 17 24  i believe the changes i have proposed could prevent these disasters from happening to anyone else the honours forfeiture committee works in private and does not publish its decisions  the process must be made open and accountable    additionally  recipients of honours who incite or encourage discrimination do not face automatic forfeiture  this must change  additional details  honours bestow credibility and prestige on individuals as a reward for bravery  achievement  or service to the uk  some recipients later prove unworthy    to maintain confidence in the honours system  the honours forfeiture committee should deliberate in public  and its decisions be published and subject to judicial review    britain also prides itself on our laws against discrimination  and individuals who have incited or encouraged discrimination must be automatically stripped of their honours campaign against antisemitism and others have long called for the regulation of social media  the #nosafespaceforjewhate campaign arose due to social media companies failure to remove hatred  the government must bring an online harms bill before parliament during 2020 and make it law by july 2021  additional details  racist material on social media has proliferated with little accountability  social networks often do not provide evidence to police  and take little action themselves  as though they bear no responsibility for the hate they publish  this must end   new legislation must urgently introduce a requirement to remove racist incitement within set timeframes  a duty of care for social networks with personal liability for executives  and tighter requirements to provide evidence to police under warrant the government should abolish cafcass and fund alternative services to support families  eg legal aid  domestic abuse support  housing for victims of domestic abuse  and their children including older male children   etc  additional details  in 2010 the public accounts committee published a report which stated that cafcass was not fit for purpose  and in 2020 a ministry of justice assessment identified deep seated and systematic issues regarding court cases involving children    we believe that cafcass is not fit for purpose  should be abolished  and alternative services to support families be funded instead currently  someone is only guilty of a sexual offence with an animal if there is full penetration  in canada  for example  any contact for a sexual purpose between a person and an animal can be a criminal offence  the government should recognise the weakness in the current law and change it  additional details  bestiality can be an indicator crime  and many offenders transfer the violence from animals to people  in the usa a study showed 31 6 percent of animal sex offenders also sexually offended against children and adults  52 9 percent had a prior or subsequent criminal record involving human sexual abuse  animal abuse  interpersonal violence  substances  or property offences  in the uk some bestiality cases are treated as an animal welfare offence only  no jail time and no referral to sex offender programmes the government should review the use of rawhide in dog treats and look at banning it as an ingredient  or at the very least ensuring that a clear warning of the dangers are displayed on all packaging of treats that use rawhide as an ingredient  additional details  many dog owners do not know the risks of rawhide products for their pets and due to this many have had their lives crushed by the devastating impact that it can have  blockages  choking and contamination are all risks associated with rawhide  while some fight through  others arent as lucky    rawhide can contain toxic chemicals  although only in trace amounts this can still cause e  coli contamination and salmonella that even humans can be at risk when coming in to contact with said bacteria change uk law to allow police forces to release video recorded on officers body cams to media outlets  and via their social media  at a senior officers discretion    the general public may make video recordings of police and publish them immediately  our police forces should have the same right  additional details  heavily edited recordings of their interactions with police are increasingly being published by members of the general public   a process needs to be introduced whereby uk police forces may take the decision to release unedited body cam footage of an incident to both mass media outlets  and their own social media   this process would allow forces to counteract  sometimes highly misleading video footage  being widely distributed with the primary intent of damaging the reputation of their officers we want longer sentences to be given to people who commit or incite crimes towards children    from physical harm to mental harm  molestation  grooming  manipulation  rape  exploitation and more  additional details  we want this changed as we believe current sentencing is not strict enough  these are the most evil of crimes and a child is the most innocent of victims   a child must be protected and be safe    too many offenders have short sentences and go on to re offend    justice is not served for all the children affected by adults who commit crimes against children  who are our future  they need protected and current sentences fail to do this   increasing sentences should keep offenders off the streets and away from our children!   being abused causes many life long issues that do not allow a person to heal and justice is needed to those who have suffered at a bare minimum change the law to ensure highways workers are afforded the same level of protection against abuse as emergency workers additional details  rates of abuse from members of the public towards highways workers are alarmingly high  the subject is largely ignored and only by the stiffening of penalties can we really effect positive changewe want police officers to be able to provide a suspension notice from the moment an offender is caught drink  drug or dangerous driving until they appear in court  it would then be for the judge to decide whether a ban continues or they are able to continue to drive again  additional details  on 24th february 2019 tom mcconnachie was killed in a hit and run by a drink driver who left tom fatally injured in the road and drove to okehampton and set fire to the vehicle  the offender was able to continue driving for 11 months before being disqualified as only a court can disqualify a driver    with toms law we want police officers to be able to issue a suspension notice to an offender when arrested at the road side to stop them from driving until they attend court to protect other road users the law allows someone who is involved is a serious or fatal car crash to leave the scene  and report the accident later     i would like people who are involved in fatal accidents and drive off  leaving the victim injured or dead to receive life sentences to stop them driving off additional details  the law needs to be changed so that any person involved in a serious or fatal accident has to stop and stay at scene and report straight away to help the injured on the road or they revive the maximum sentence for life for leaving a person to die on road    at present the british law acts as an incentive for law braking drivers to flee the scene of the kill someone  i want the sentence to be a deterrent from other drivers doing this and maybe we will be able to save lives on the roadministers should urgently change the law to make sprinklers compulsory in all new build and refurbished schools as is the case in scotland and wales   investing in sprinklers is a small price to pay for improving the resilience of the school estate and protecting young peoples education  additional details  schools could be almost twice as likely to be hit by a fire as other non residential buildings  according to research by the insurer zurich  unlike scotland and wales  there is no legal requirement in england for sprinklers to be fitted in new build and refurbished schools   with government data showing almost 2 000 school blazes over the last three years  this is costing taxpayers millions of pounds  harming childrens education  and potentially putting lives at risk extend the parameters of the building safety fund for non acm cladding  to treat everyone fairly by including under 18m buildings  to broaden the scope and funding to include wood balconies  wooden walkways  compartmentalisation issues and fund historical fire safety work  additional details  to support those in multi storey buildings under 18m  with the same equality as all high rise buildings hundreds of thousands of leaseholders are trapped in their homes facing bankruptcy from life changing bills for waking watches  alarms and fire safety remediation  we want government to protect them by implementing the select committees cladding  progress of remediation report recommendations  additional details  recommendations include but are not limited to     increasing the building safety fund to address all fire safety defects in every high risk residential building   providing funding for interim fire safety measures  such as waking watches and fire alarms   ensuring those responsible for the crisis contribute to the fund   use of cpo powers to take direct ownership of the freehold of buildings with serious fire safety defects   putting in place a much faster  fairer system than the ews1 processanyone caught desecrating a war memorial in the uk should be imprisoned  it is unacceptable  additional details  to ensure the police and crown prosecution service provide all victims of child sexual abuse with counselling and support before during and after trial  this is in gov legislation  but the cps and police still advise victims to the contrary in order to avoid contamination of evidence  this needs to end  additional details  there is a moral duty for cps and police to provide counselling to victims without fear it may affect their trial or justice  my brother declan was raped by a paedophile  before the trial my mum begged cps  police and local authority to provide support for her children but was told this would  contaminate court evidence  my brother took his own life at 13  his death could have been prevented  declans law  would ensure future csa victims get the support they deserve
