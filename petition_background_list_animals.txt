as our representatives  i want the government to ensure that any agreements made do not undermine the uks food production and welfare standards  if it would be illegal to produce and sell in the uk  it should be illegal to import it  additional details  i do not agree that the vote on the agricultural bill was an accurate representation of the publics view  it would not be right to sell food in the uk that would be illegal to produce in the uk  i want all food that is sold in the uk to be from farms that have a minimum production and welfare standard  it is undeniable that the uk has some of the highest welfare standards in the world  this is because of years of campaigns  petitions and manifestos  including yours   this shouldnt be subvertedthese collars are designed to control dogs by inflicting pain  there are many painless alternatives which makes this practice outdated  please ban choke and pronged collars because their use can cause harm and is cruel and unnecessary punishment  additional details  choke and pronged collars can cause physical and emotional damage  whiplash  puncturing the skin  spinal cord injuries and crushing the trachea are some examples  a dog  like a child  is totally dependent on its owner and their choices  choosing to hurt the dog to correct it when there are other options must be considered inhumane  please consider if  what amounts to torture of a dog  is acceptable in our society and should it be outlawed under the animal welfare actcreate regular tunnels under the railway to connect habitats and provide safe passage for wildlife  this should be a mixture of small tunnels for small mammals  invertebrates and amphibians  large tunnels for deer and badgers  and culverts for aquatic semi aquatic life  additional details  overground areas of hs2 pose a variety of threats to wildlife by blocking movement or causing direct mortality  wildlife tunnels can mitigate these effects by connecting fragmented urban and rural habitat and reducing collisions   it has been extremely successful with other infrastructure projects across the world  connectivity is vital for maintaining genetic diversity and allowing animals assess different territories  resources and mates  all vital for preventing further species decline under the 1967 forestry act licences to fell woodland cannot include enforceable conditions to safeguard our rarest wildlife such as red squirrels  bats  dormice   https   www independent co uk environment red squirrels rare woodland wildlife british outdated tree felling a8665491 html additional details  woodlands are routinely clear felled or left with only a few trees containing squirrel nests  there is always a risk that young animals are either shredded or crushed by such felling   the public want ethically harvested timber so felling licences need enforceable conditions to protect wildlife  the government should amend forestry legislation so this is the case in england  as it already is in scotland make it a legal requirement for owners to neuter spay their cat  and for kittens to be neutered no later than 4 months of age  registered cat breeders are to be exempt from this law  this will help reduce the stray population  lessen the strain on rescue charities  and save thousands of cats lives  additional details  there are more than 9 million stray  and 1 5 million feral cats in the uk  cats protection  2018   neutered tom cats are reported to live 62 percent longer than intact males  and spayed females 39 percent longer than intact females  the average lifespan of a stray cat is just 2 years  intact female kittens can be impregnated at only 4 months of age  intact toms spread disease and fight  so often end up with infected wounds  the british veterinary association strongly support the routine neutering of cats all meat and meat product sellers  at the point of sale  to publicly display documentation  written and with clear photographs describing how meat animals were bred  their living conditions  method and typical age at slaughter and the percentage of animals accidentally or purposely unstunned  additional details  consumers may be unaware that many animals are intensively farmed  with some living in much of their own urine and excrement and speedily deprived of their young  consumers are often unaware that scientists believe animals feel emotion  including pain  fear and frustration  it is important that consumers are well informed so that they can make an educated choice as to whether or not they want to eat it  documentation and photographs should be publicly verifiable in order to improve public health  combat climate change and reduce animal suffering  the government should   1  commit to end factory farming  starting by phasing out existing ‘megafarms  2  set a target of a 50 percent reduction in meat and dairy consumption by 2030 and impose taxes to achieve this  additional details  factory farming can spread disease and cause animal suffering and is contributing to climate change  with over 37 percent of methane emissions originating from factory farming   meat and dairy consumption can also negatively impact human health  and who has classified processed meat as a group 1 carcinogen require animal breeders and shelters to conduct home checks physically or virtually on anyone coming to them to rehome or adopt an animal  this is to provide education  ensure commitment and look out for the best interests of the animal   additional details  the government should also create a national database of those banned from keeping animals to allow registered breeders and shelters to check they are not dealing with a convicted animal abuser   pdsa stated that a high number of people underestimated the cost and responsibilities of having a pet when purchased from a breeder rather than an animal shelter  they said this is because most shelters conduct an informative home check to ensure realistic expectations  the ‘animal welfare report 2019 shows a high percentage of animal owners are not meeting the basic needs of their pets  this is harmful to their wellbeing  this could be reduced via education  home checks and the use of a cruelty database licensed breeders can rotate their breeding bitches  buying in pregnant bitches swapping them for whelped  breeders can stay within their license at any one time and always have pregnant and whelping bitches  increasing litters dealt with and sold by 5 times the number of dogs on their license  additional details  animal welfare can be compromised when dogs can be swapped and change locations in order to give a breeder increased income  some of these dogs can be provided by puppy mills and is easier than transporting puppies  which lucys law has prevented  there remains this loophole in the law and this can be closed by including a limit on the number of litters a breeder can deal with or sell which is the same as the number of dogs stipulated on the licence  making choosing a breeder clearer for pet owners the uk government should seek to persuade governments of countries where bear bile farming takes place to outlaw and act to end this practice  abuse of bears has no place in the modern world  and the uk government should not stand by and do nothing in the face of such barbaric animal cruelty  additional details  bear bile is used in certain traditional medicines  but this does not justify the practice of bear bile farming  and research has shown that there are substitutes to bear bile there appears to be an alarming rise in dogs imported after undergoing the inhumane procedure of having their ears mutilated  fulfilling the desire for a certain ‘look and encouraging a procedure outlawed in england since 1899  its time to close this 121 year old legal loophole  additional details  cropping a dogs ears is illegal in the uk  yet the numbers appear to be rising  an import ban could be possible under trade rules  there are companies that specifically import dogs with cropped ears for uk owners fuelling cruelty abroad  its time to make imports illegal  raise awareness of the cruelty around cropped dogs and advise the public not to support companies individuals that use cropped dogs in advertising and social media  as theyre inadvertently promoting this painful practice the government should ban uk travel companies from selling tickets to all international attractions holding captive dolphins  whales or porpoises  excluding those solely for rehabilitation   there have been no captive cetaceans in the uk for over 25 years  additional details  whales  dolphins and porpoises are some of the most intelligent and emotionally aware animals  they should not spend their lives in concrete tanks  captivity is a very damaging experience for cetaceans which often involves the separation of babies from mothers  wild capture and performing unnatural behaviours  this can lead to depression and even self harm  the only exclusion is when held solely for rehabilitation  with no shows or swim withs  to be released to the wild or into sea pens shooting of badgers is licensed by natural england as part of the defra badger cull  24 000+ badgers were shot in 2019  additional details  shooting is poorly monitored and wild justice believes it has never met the animal welfare standards recommended by a 2014 independent expert panel  whose recommendations were accepted by defra  this method of culling is inhumane and should be banned immediately we want the government to highlight  promote and support the importance of creating pollinator networks nationwide  a super highway for pollinators that connects landscapes ward by ward  borough by borough  county by county and region by region  thus building a network of habitats for pollinators  additional details  a third of british wild bees and pollinators are in decline  if current trends continue  some species will be lost from britain indefinitely  pollination is mutually beneficial to plants and pollinators  pollinators are an essential component of the habitats and ecosystem that we and many animals rely on for food  shelter and well being  this network  the bee superhighway  will foster that and help the long term sustainability of food production and wildlife livelihood and we must encourage it i am calling on the government to fund local councils to improve bridleway routes by upgrading appropriate footpaths to create links  either permanently or through seasonal permissive routes  and ensuring there is safe access to current bridlepaths where access has been lost  additional details  no one wants horses on roads   not drivers  not riders  not horses  its dangerous  not relaxing and its horses and riders who pay the price with their lives   the british horse society figures show that nov 2010   mar 2019 there were 3 737 incidents reported    315 horses and 43 riders were killed on our roads during this time   but if riders want to ride out there is little choice  there are some fantastic  bridlepaths but the quiet country lanes have become shortcuts for busy commuters and most riders do not have the funds or access to transport to take their horses to forests or private grounds dogs  cats and live stock are increasingly being attacked by out of control dogs resulting in trauma and death   increase and include compulsory penalties for dog attacks and attempted attacks on other animals   provide pet dogs with the same rights under the dangerous dog act as assistance dogs  additional details  dogs are being killed by other dogs both on and off leads due to their owners being unable to control them  halal and kosher meat must be intended for consumption by jews or muslims  but we believe this requirement is too vague and open to misuse producers who use religious slaughter methods  and results in excess meat being slaughtered in this way and passed on without labelling  additional details  the government should require that meat slaughtered religiously should only be for consumption by jews or muslims  and that all halal and kosher meat is labelled clearly at the point of retail  both at shops and eateries  so that all consumers are able to choose whether to purchase meat that has been slaughtered in this way now the hedgehog has been listed as vulnerable to extinction in the uk  we are calling on the government to move hedgehogs to schedule 5 of the wildlife and countryside act 1981 to allow them greater protection  additional details  this change will mean hedgehogs will be afforded greater protection and hopefully help their numbers recover ensure that the recent restrictions of social gatherings to six individuals from different households also extend to outdoor activities including the hunting and shooting of grouse  foxes  and other animals  additional details  this is a time of national crisis  when everyones personal freedoms have been necessarily limited  it is therefore entirely unacceptable that special provisions be given to particular pastimes and leisure purists  covid 19 doesnt distinguish between 30 people gathered to hunt grouse  and 30 people gathered to play and watch football  rugby  ultimate frisbee  quidditch or any other sport   the government should ensure that all groups abide by the rules  only then will this crisis be averted there are two major flaws with the current compulsory microchipping system  optional scanning and the lack of a single database  there are 13 microchip databases on the government list  independent commercial enterprises  different processes and no interest in creating a central standardised register! additional details  to confuse matters further  microchipping databases which do not meet government standards continue to trade  and often rank highly on search engines  if you register on an unlisted database  not only can you be fined £500 but your pets microchip will read as unregistered when scanned   the government should introduce a single database of microchipped cats and dogs  and make it compulsory for chips to be checked at 1st veterinary appointment for the most recent hunting season  forestry england gave hunting licences for 34 fox and hare “trail hunts”  despite hunting wild mammals with dogs being illegal  two of the licensed previously licensed trail hunts have been associated with convictions under the hunting and animal welfare acts  additional details  other licensed fox hunts have recently been in the press for alleged trespass  killing foxes  losing control of their dogs and for another criminal conviction  a saboteur was severely injured at a hunt in early september that ordinarily receives a licence from forestry england    it is only a matter of time before more convictions and more bans will have to be implemented  the answer is simple and effective   stop granting licences to hunts that are continuing to use the myth of ‘trail hunting to chase and kill wildlife
