Cervical screening needs to be every year  This is because women are dying  mothers  wives  daughters  granddaughters and sisters are dying Additional Details  We need yearly checks regardless of the statistics  It should be law that every women in England can access a yearly smear test   So they have a future  You are preventing women from watching their children grow  My friend will never see her children s first day at school  watch her children grow  fall in love  watch them get married or hold her grandchildren  This could have been prevented I want reversing cameras to be compulsory for all commercial vehicles on the road without a rear view  I am particularly concerned with the increased number of delivery drivers in residential areas without rear view vision Additional Details  My 87 year old father has just recovered from COVID 19 after 2 weeks in hospital  On Thursday 21st May he was hit from behind  by a reversing delivery van whilst taking a stroll in his quiet cul de sac in the retirement village where he lives  As a result of this I am setting up a campaign to make reversing cameras compulsory on vans and lorries  Surely we should no longer accept the if you can t see my wing mirrors I can t see you  signs on vehicles when the technology is easily available  We would like SIA licenced security staff to be added to the Assaults on Emergency Workers  Act 2018Additional Details  As we have seen over the pandemic crisis  key workers are an essential part to our everyday lives  Security staff  along with the police and ambulance and fire  help keep law and order  It is only right that the privileges that are afforded by this law is also offered out to SIA licence security staff Review planning legislation to force councils to include adequate safe and secure HGV parking with refreshment and washing facilities for drivers when allowing large distribution parks to be built  based on percentage capacity  or when undertaking major road improvement or construction works Additional Details  HGV traffic is a direct indication on the health of a nation s economy  Providing drivers with adequate parking areas prevents conflict with those who disapprove of this vital industry  protects the welfare of the driver and improves road safety and the safety of the vehicle  It will encourage new blood to the industry Sexual assault can have a devastating impact on children as they grow up and victims in general  This crime can change a persons life forever  I think the prison sentences and punishments for crimes like these as too soft and more needs to be done in terms of deterring this sort of crime Additional Details  We need to set an example  Child trafficking and child abuse goes on more than we think and we need to do more  The prison sentences abusers get is nothing compared to the lifelong trauma they inflict on their victims  I would like more funding to go to charities that help the victims of sexual abuse however I don t think it s enough  We need to set a standard  We need to protect our children and ourselves  The people in charge need speak for the millions of people who feel this way Anyone entering the UK who are not residents or British Nationals  must provide proof of valid medical insurance at  Border Control  before they are permitted to enter the UK  This should ensure that these visitors will not be a burden on the NHS or UK economy  should medical care be required Additional Details  Following the huge financial burden/deficit post Covid19  all public monies must be fully collected and accounted for  before spending appropriately I want the Government to prevent any restrictions being placed on those who refuse to have any potential Covid 19 vaccine  This includes restrictions on travel  social events  such as concerts or sports  No restrictions whatsoever Additional Details  You cannot force someone to have a vaccination  and should not be able to coerce them into it by way of restrictions  We have to the right to assess the risk ourselves as we have done in the past This is a petition for an Alevi faith tick box to be included as an option  in the 2021 census  which in England and Wales will be administered by the Office for National Statistics  ONS  Additional Details  The campaign is led by the British Alevi Federation and we believe the Government and ONS should listen carefully to the concerns raised  Data about minority groups is vital because underreporting could allow discrimination to go unnoticed  We ask the ONS to include a separate tick box in the next UK census in 2021 and to change the question as the same in Scotland and Northern Ireland to ‘What religion  religious denomination or body do you belong to   I want a reduction in Council tax for people on private estates paying stewardship/management fees Additional Details  I don t see why people paying fees for estate management should pay full council tax like people who aren t  Surely we are paying for some of the services twice  How is this fair or legal  If the council aren t responsible for the upkeep of the area then surely the home owner and the landlords in that area should get a reduction in council tax fees In order to increase the wide adoption of fully Electric Vehicles  make all charging points accept contactless payments and ban mandatory sign up requirements for their use Additional Details  One of the biggest barriers to electric vehicle EV  adoption is the need to sign up to several pre payment apps in order to use the charging networks While the private sector is an important part of the EV networks future  their excessive range of RFID cards  apps and websites make their use frustrating  I am asking that all public charging points are made to accept contactless/Card payments and that mandatory sign up is banned Psychiatric wards are often mixed sex  Patients can be unable to get food  drink  medication  see visitors or doctors without passing through or using mixed sex areas Bathrooms and dormitories are single sex but staff are not always present  sexual assaults are not uncommon on mixed sex wards  Additional Details  Mixed sex wards can feel as if they lack privacy and at times can feel unsafe  Some patients have a history of abuse and trauma and need a single sex environment to heal  The Government should require the NHS provide single sex psychiatric wards so that this is possible Adopt a system whereby  in the event of an incident  the liability for the incident falls on the larger vehicle  It will be up to the larger vehicle to prove that it was not their fault Additional Details  For the sake of the environment  the nation s health  to alleviate the burden on the NHS and for the sake of our economy we need to encourage more people to get on their bikes and to walk  By introducing legislation whereby the larger vehicle is presumed to be at fault in the event of an incident  drivers should be more inclined to show greater respect for other road users Many ELT schools are excluded from the business rates relief scheme for retail  hospitality and leisure businesses  despite providing educational holidays for 550 000 overseas visitors a year  Schools closed their doors as part of the national effort to keep people safe but now face financial ruin Additional Details  The Chancellor announced that all retail  hospitality and leisure businesses in England   those most impacted by Covid 19   would benefit from a business rates holiday for the next 12 months  However  due to some unclear guidance from the Ministry of Communities  Housing and Local Government  many English language schools are being deemed as ineligible by local authorities  Without this relief  many schools will be lost along with the jobs that they support and other benefits they bring to the UK The police complaints system is overly complex  Police have unlimited time to investigate and respond to serious issues and take action  28 days to fully respond to all complaints is achievable and would give the general public reassurance  instead of potentially having to wait years for a response Additional Details  People should be able to complain against police forces and receive a timely response  which should support continuous improvement by police forces  Assaults and mistreatment by police officers should be effectively responded to and dealt with as expeditiously as possible  I myself complained about being assaulted by the police and had to wait 3 years for video evidence of this police assault  This needs to change for everybody Extend the existing deadline of 1st January 2026 to record historic paths onto Definitive Maps  as required by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000  for a further 10 years until 2036 Recording a single path can take years  more time is needed to record them all  or they will be lost for ever Additional Details  Thousands of our historic Rights of Way  some used for centuries  are not officially mapped  If not recorded by 1st January 2026  they will be closed and lost forever  The legal process for recording a path  often done by volunteers  is time consuming and may take several years  There is not enough time left to record all our footpaths and bridleways  Our rights to walk and ride through the land are part of our national heritage  these rights should not be lost because of an arbitrary deadline British Basketball has been underfunded for years  leaving the professional league in the UK at an extremely precarious position during the current pandemic  I would like the government to give the BBL the requested 1 million pounds asked for by Sir Rodney Walker to survive the current situation Additional Details  I would like the government to fulfil the basketball community s request as basketball has been proven to be one of the most popular sports by participation  According to Statista  Rugby League had 62 000 participants playing it in the UK whereas Basketball had 280 000 participating in the UK  Rugby League was given 15 million pounds  basketball was given nothing  The loss of the league would be extremely detrimental to Basketball in the UK I would like women to be offered a smear test from the age of 16 in the UK instead of having to wait until you are 25 Additional Details  Many women have signs of cervical cancer but are not offered a smear test until they are 25 years old  I believe you should be offered a smear test from the age of 16 as this is when you are legally allowed to be sexually active Dementia effects all ages  but many hospitals do not have specialised facilities to meet the needs of people with dementia and their carers  The Government should fund dedicated dementia wards in all hospitals  to provide advice  right environment  targeted medical treatment and comfort Additional Details  Dedicated wards would consist of nurses  doctors and other specialists who would be able to give the right treatment and assistance  in discussion with patients and carers  We believe the benefits of improving specialised care would far outweigh the costs We petition the Government to revoke its support for large scale nuclear power projects  They would be counter productive to the UK s economic recovery  its climate targets and future national security Additional Details  Large nuclear projects are now too costly  however funded  too slow to construct  too fraught with technical obstacles and too controversial if run by overseas developers  Rather than contributing to a sustainable Green Recovery I worry they are draining funding  time and government attention from solutions that are much more deliverable and cost effective The Government should cancel GCSEs and A Levels in 2021 due to the disruption of Covid 19  By the time students go back to normal learning  6 months will have passed since schools were closed to most pupils  This has already had a huge impact on the studying of so many Additional Details  Students in the UK have already missed hundreds of hours of learning since 23rd March  This has had a huge effect  Some pupils don t have the essential resources  a working computer  textbooks  stationary  etc  Many don t have a proper learning environment  therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true efforts of pupils  Hence why I am writing to the Government to cancel GCSEs and A Levels and provide predicted grades to show the true reflections of students across the country Update the guidance sent to local councils so that it includes ‘event hire  and ‘exhibition  companies  This will allow councils to pay these companies the grants and reduced business rates that they have been promised by the Chancellor Additional Details  The Chancellor said in the House of Commons that event hire and exhibition companies fell under the umbrella of leisure and hospitality and as such would qualify for the Retail  Leisure and Hospitality Grant  The guidance sent to local councils does not include them  and as such  they are being refused the support promised  Councils need the guidance to be updated in order to support an industry devastated by Covid 19  The government is using some of the venues we work in as Nightingale Hospitals Back in 1968 people with CF were not included on the medical exemption list as children with cf were not expected to make it to adulthood  Now the median life expectancy for those living with cystic fibrosis is 37  This lack of an exemption needs to be revised Additional Details  Many people in the UK with cystic fibrosis have to pay prescription charges  I feel this is so wrong when a lot of others are exempt yet some with cystic fibrosis are expected to pay  Some people with CF have to take up to 11 different types of tablets a day  without antibiotics  Why should they be made to pay for prescriptions  We need to make this change  It s hard enough living with cystic fibrosis  let alone having to find the money to pay for all prescriptions or a yearly payment The UK Government urge the International Criminal Court to investigate crimes against the Tamil population in Sri Lanka between 1980 to the present day Additional Details  Sri Lanka will never find peace if any crimes against the Tamil are not recognised or appropriately remembered  We need accountability  The UK Government should do all it can to help the Tamil people We want the Government to reinstate the pre 2012 Overseas Domestic Worker visa in order to enable migrant domestic workers to renew their visas  which are currently capped at 6 months  and to ensure there is a route to settlement  also known as Indefinite Leave to Remain  Additional Details  Migrant domestic workers  visas are capped at six months and there is no way for them to renew them  leading many MDWs become undocumented after six months has elapsed  MDWs are already at a greater risk of experiencing forced labour and abuse  which only increases among those that are undocumented  The ability to renew the visa with a route to settlement will enable MDWs to seek support if their employer is abusive  and will enable them to continue to contribute to society As our representatives  I want the government to ensure that any agreements made do not undermine the UK s food production and welfare standards  If it would be illegal to produce and sell in the UK  it should be illegal to import it Additional Details  I do not agree that the vote on the Agricultural Bill was an accurate representation of the public s view  it would not be right to sell food in the UK that would be illegal to produce in the UK  I want all food that is sold in the UK to be from farms that have a minimum production and welfare standard  It is undeniable that the UK has some of the highest welfare standards in the world  this is because of years of campaigns  petitions and manifestos  including yours   this shouldn t be subvertedI would like a public vote/referendum on whether we want to spend in excess of £100 billion on a train project which will destroy or irreparably damage natural habitats and wildlife sites along the route Additional Details  To me  the damage and cost to public land  wildlife and nature at a time of Environmental emergency and recession outweighs the long term benefits of travel  The HS2 project should be decided by the people paying for it  the tax payers  It s destroying communities and environment The Government should make it a criminal offence to use images of people without their consent to mock them online  It should also look at how those posting content from other countries  or on sites hosted in other countries but available in the UK  can be prosecuted and brought to justice  Additional Details  My 21 month old grandson was killed in 2013 and was targeted by a US website  He was called horrific racist names and his death mocked because he was black  The Government should do all it can to stop this abhorrent material Thousands of patients worldwide  are reporting long term health problems due to  Post COVID 19 symptoms  for  mild/moderate  cases The majority of patients were too  well  to be admitted to hospital  and too ill to remain at home and are left without help and advice Additional Details  There s no record of many patient s illnesses as testing was unavailable  some are too ill to resume normal life and are expected to work  others tested positive and are also expected to work  These people are stuck in limbo and need urgent support Can the government look into this immediately and provide resources for research for the thousands of citizens stuck with the long term effects of C 19  and the publication and promotion of advice and support   These collars are designed to control dogs by inflicting pain  There are many painless alternatives which makes this practice outdated  Please ban choke and pronged collars because their use can cause harm and is cruel and unnecessary punishment Additional Details  Choke and pronged collars can cause physical and emotional damage  Whiplash  puncturing the skin  spinal cord injuries and crushing the trachea are some examples  A dog  like a child  is totally dependent on it s owner and their choices  Choosing to hurt the dog to correct it when there are other options must be considered inhumane  Please consider if  what amounts to torture of a dog  is acceptable in our society and should it be outlawed under the Animal Welfare ActThe Home Secretary said what happened to victims of child sexual exploitation gangs was “one of the biggest stains on our country s conscience ” Last year local authorities identified 18 700 suspected victims of child sexual exploitation  We want an independent public inquiry into Grooming Gangs Additional Details  Last year we learned 57 young girls were thought to have been exploited by up to 100 members of a grooming gang  There is clear public concern  and appear to be failings by Police  Social Services  Local Authorities and the CPS to protect the most vulnerable A public inquiry should answer  What happened  Who is to blame  What can be done to prevent this happening again  Is there a racial/religious element to this type of offending  How are survivors being supported and should more be done We want the UK government to    Extend the law on coercive control  s 76 Serious Crime Act 2015  to cover circumstances where a victim has left the relationship  To remove the defense under s 76 8  where a perp can claim they were acting in the victim s best interest Additional Details  S 76 Serious Crime Act 2015 rightly recognises the horrific impact that coercive control has on victims of domestic abuse  However  it does not recognise that  for many victims  this abuse continues once they have left the abuser  Stalking and harassment law doesn t provide effective coverage   which often leaves victims without protection  S 76 8  also gives the abuser an unnecessary defence   that they were acting in the victim s best interest  They never are so this must be removed!Crohn s and Colitis are lifelong Inflammatory Bowel Diseases with no current cure  Living with a chronic condition is physically  mentally and emotionally draining  Knowing you have to take medication for the rest of your life is tough  but that medication doesn t come free  or cheap Additional Details  A PPC costs £29 65 for 3 months or £105 90 for 12 months  which is cheaper than paying for individual prescriptions but isn t enough  it should be free  Having these conditions also means having time off work or some may not be able to work at all  It s not fair that whilst earning less money or no money at all we still have to pay for medication  IBD patients should be medically exempt so they never have to worry about not being able to have access to crucial medications ever again Fire safety is a natural concern within the building sector after the Grenfell tragedy The EWS1 form is designed to identify tall buildings where lives are at risk  but leaseholders in safe  modern  and even <18m buildings are left unable to sell or remortgage as lenders demand invasive surveys Additional Details  Three issues need resolving 1  Lenders should not be able to require an EWS1 form for buildings that were never intended to need one  2  Building surveyors  rather than fire engineers  need to be insured to carry out surveys on low risk buildings  to help reduce the two year backlog which is trapping residents  3  Requiring invasive surveys to establish new building safety is a Pandora s box  Engineers  architects and builders must be compelled to produce evidence of safe construction Football  rugby  cricket and other sports clubs should be allowed to reopen to spectators  with reduced capacities  if they are able to prove they can comply with social distancing requirements  If other businesses are allowed to reopen  sports should not be discriminated against Additional Details  The Government has allowed leisure businesses to reopen from 4th July with social distancing requirements in place  Providing sports clubs can comply with the same requirements they should be allowed to reopen with limited capacities to allow them access to sources of income  Large scale protests have recently been held without emergency services being overwhelmed indicating the country is ready to start reopening the economy  Sports events should not be treated any differently There should be a public inquiry into Government contracts granted during Covid 19  Many contracts have been granted without full and open procurement processes  A public inquiry would be able to ascertain whether contracts had been procured fairly and represent value for money for tax payers Additional Details  Create regular tunnels under the railway to connect habitats and provide safe passage for wildlife  This should be a mixture of small tunnels for small mammals  invertebrates and amphibians  large tunnels for deer and badgers  and culverts for aquatic/semi aquatic life Additional Details  Overground areas of HS2 pose a variety of threats to wildlife by blocking movement or causing direct mortality  Wildlife tunnels can mitigate these effects by connecting fragmented urban and rural habitat and reducing collisions   it has been extremely successful with other infrastructure projects across the world  Connectivity is vital for maintaining genetic diversity and allowing animals assess different territories  resources and mates  all vital for preventing further species decline Under the 1967 Forestry Act licences to fell woodland cannot includeenforceable conditions to safeguard our rarest wildlife such as redsquirrels  bats  dormice https //www independent co uk/environment/red squirrels rare woodland wildlife british outdated tree felling a8665491 htmlAdditional Details  Woodlands are routinely clear felled or left with only a few treescontaining squirrel nests  There is always a risk that young animals areeither shredded or crushed by such felling The public want ethically harvested timber so felling licences needenforceable conditions to protect wildlife  The Government should amendForestry legislation so this is the case in England  as it already is inScotland Change the law to make the process easier so that the father s name  who has died before the child s registration of birth  can be recorded on the child s birth certificate  This could be done by the deceased s legal next of kin representing the deceased with legal documentation at the registration Additional Details  The law does not allow an unmarried mother to place the father s name on the child s birth certificate without them being present  When the father is deceased it is impossible to register them on the birth certificate without having to go through financial burdens  legal processes and added heartache  This could be seen as discrimination  I want my child to have his father s name on his birth certificate as it is bad enough he has lost his father already and I am not alone in this situation Tackle the rising far right and fascists in the UK by introducing legislation similar to the German Strafgesetzbuch section 86a  making the use of nazi symbolism and nazi salutes illegal and punishable Additional Details  Scenes of Nazi salutes under the shadow of war memorials must be tackled  Thus far  it seems the police are left to resort to a public order offence and may not want to apply this post incident  for example  when video evidence is available   A specific offence would make this abhorrent behaviour much easier to prosecute and remove from our streets Childminders who care for their own children  or those related to them  are unable to claim the 15 free hours  funding which is universally available to all 3 to 4 year olds in England  Childminders must therefore send their child to another childcare setting or miss out on this financial assistanceAdditional Details  Sending children to a second childcare provider would go against current government guidance and would put minded families at increased risk  Covid 19 has put many childminders in enormous financial difficulty  which is set to continue as parents are cautious or financially unable to resume childcare  Allowing childminders to claim funded hours to safely care for related children at home would offer much needed financial support  benefiting all children and the viability of childcare providersClose down and prevent opening of any business that operates under the  Multilevel marketing business model Additional Details  This business model is extremely predatory and less than 10percent of people who take part in such businesses make enough money from it to be making a livable wage  Many people tricked into these businesses actually lose money as there are often monthly minimum comission requirements to retain seller status  It s also almost always impossible to make any money without recruiting others under oneself  thus an MLM business is essentially a pyramid scheme with productsI would like the government to provide funding for surgical correction of Pectus Excavatum on the NHS  following the decision by NHS England not to include it in its commissioning policy  Additional Details  In 2019 NHS England published a clinical commissioning policy for surgery for pectus deformity in all ages   NHS England Reference  170113P  It stated that NHS England will not routinely commission surgery for pectus deformity  The justification was that on reviewing the evidence it was concluded that the clinical trials were not set up to show a clear clinical benefit of surgical intervention  This doesn t mean that patients haven t and wouldn t benefit from it clinically and psychologically Extend the furlough  even at a reduced rate  Save the technical crews before it s to late Additional Details  Without theatres and live music venues where will your culture grow  We need theatre from  Shakespeare to Jack in the Beanstalk  Live music venues start people s careers and I argue that Rap to Opera are as important to our culture as football and pubs We demand the UK government to urge the Government of India  through diplomatic channels  for the safe return of British Muslims detained in India Additional Details  Family members of UK citizens have contacted the PM  Foreign Secretary  and their local MPs by email and letters  UK citizens along with 2 000 foreign citizens  approximately  from 35 countries  Malaysia  Indonesia  Ivory Coast  Thailand  Sudan  Gambia  West Indies  Algeria etc  are being incarcerated in different parts of India  having been accused of visa violations and spreading of COVID 19  The Government should negotiate the release and return of the British Muslims being detained Change English and Welsh marriage laws to recognize traditional Pagan wedding ceremonies in particular the practice of handfasting as a legal act of marriage  At present we must instead travel over the Scottish border to wed in accordance with our ancient faith  This is unfair and discriminatory Additional Details  The prejudice and superstition that surrounds the over 53 000 Pagans in England today is very sad to witness  Many families have been practicing Paganism for generations  it is a long misunderstood faith that centers its beliefs in the natural world and doing only good  It is only the ignorance of others that prevents English pagans from being able to have equal rights in marriage  Legalizing Pagan wedding ceremonies will help to end the stigma that surrounds us  and give us the power to express our faith and worship freely Weddings take months and even years of intricate planning  Myself and many others believe the maximum number of guests authorised at wedding ceremonies should be increased  The number of guests permitted at weddings should be calculated according to venue capacity Additional Details  For instance  if a venue has a capacity of 600 people social distancing could still be practised with 1/5 of this number  People should not have to alter their plans if social distancing is observed  Surely  if beaches are allowed to remain open  weddings should be permitted to go ahead considering appropriate measures are put in place  It is more than apparent social distancing is not practised at such public places of leisure  thus guidelines for weddings should be reconsidered I would like to see 6 monthly testing for all Members of Parliament for alcohol and drugs  This would be compulsory  Also there would be an element of random testing Additional Details  I would like to feel reassured that the people charged with running the UK are actually fit to do so The government must absolutely and 100percent rule out the possibility of leaving the EU  ending the transition period  without a deal!!! We are still in the middle of Covid 19 and business already affected by thatAdditional Details  And no deal means medication shortages!!!! SO I ask the government to take no deal off the table!!! Plenty of lives lost to Covid 19 and plenty of people who have lost jobs So rule out ending the transition period without a deal!!Make carers allowance equivalent to a fair wage and allow multiple carers allowance  with a limit  where more than 1 person is cared for  Additional Details  For example  a family with 2 disabled children affects a parent being able to work part time or full time but current rules of claiming for 1 cared person does not cover the carer financially Carers are grossly underpaid and the system does not recognised when a carer cares for more than one person Make it a legal requirement for owners to neuter/spay their cat  and for kittens to be neutered no later than 4 months of age  Registered cat breeders are to be exempt from this law  This will help reduce the stray population  lessen the strain on rescue charities  and save thousands of cat s lives Additional Details  There are more than 9 million stray  and 1 5 million feral cats in the uk  Cats Protection  2018   Neutered tom cats are reported to live 62percent longer than intact males  and spayed female s 39percent longer than intact females  The average lifespan of a stray cat is just 2 years  Intact female kittens can be impregnated at only 4 months of age  Intact toms spread disease and fight  so often end up with infected wounds  The British Veterinary Association strongly support the routine neutering of cats Being the first to close and still no clue as to when we can open  this seasonal industry is losing its summer profits that allows them to get through the first quarter of next year  Even if we are allowed to open in December  1 months profit won t be enough to keep us open in 2021  We need helpAdditional Details  This seasonal sector was closed down just before the season started  We make profit spring  summer and Christmas time  These profits are how the industry get through the Jan Feb March so with out summer  businesses will close  We were the first to be closed and still have no idea when we are allowed to open again  We rely on volume to trade and without mass gatherings being allowed we are closed   We cannot top up wages and cannot pay after October so many of us will close  PLEASE HELP USAll meat and meat product sellers  at the point of sale  to publicly display documentation  written and with clear photographs describing how meat animals were bred  their living conditions  method and typical age at slaughter and the percentage of animals accidentally or purposely unstunned Additional Details  Consumers may be unaware that many animals are intensively farmed  with some living in much of their own urine and excrement and speedily deprived of their young  Consumers are often unaware that scientists believe animals feel emotion  including pain  fear and frustration  It is important that consumers are well informed so that they can make an educated choice as to whether or not they want to eat it  Documentation and photographs should be publicly verifiable We require tourist visas from Colombian citizensAdditional Details  Britain may be missing an opportunity to be a key player in growth and evolution of this ambitious society that Colombia is today  The founder of The Republic of Colombia  Simón Bolivar  was a great anglophile  Probably which is why Bogotá  the capital of Colombia  is full of Victorian architecture and resembles London in many places  Perhaps his admiration of Anglo Saxon evolutionary style society determined what Colombia is today The Government should review how maternity wards triage patients  with a view to mandating a standard risk assessment based system for maternity and triage  assessing every patient within 15 minutes and prioritising care based on urgency  should be implemented Additional Details  Upon arrival at triage I was not seen for 40 minutes  I was not assessed for a further 1 hour and 5 minutes  then my CTG was not reviewed for an hour  I believe a lack of risk assessment and all of these delays were the reason for my son s death  If the hospital had used standard risk assessment based system my baby s death could have been prevented  Similar cases could be prevented if risk assessments are done properly and sooner In order to improve public health  combat climate change and reduce animal suffering  the Government should 1  Commit to end factory farming  starting by phasing out existing ‘megafarms  2  Set a target of a 50percent reduction in meat and dairy consumption by 2030 and impose taxes to achieve this Additional Details  Factory farming can spread disease and cause animal suffering and is contributing to climate change  with over 37percent of methane emissions originating from factory farming Meat and dairy consumption can also negatively impact human health  and WHO has classified processed meat as a Group 1 carcinogen Require animal breeders and shelters to conduct home checks physically or virtually on anyone coming to them to rehome or adopt an animal  This is to provide education  ensure commitment and look out for the best interests of the animal  Additional Details  The Government should also create a national database of those banned from keeping animals to allow registered breeders and shelters to check they are not dealing with a convicted animal abuser PDSA stated that a high number of people underestimated the cost and responsibilities of having a pet when purchased from a breeder rather than an animal shelter  They said this is because most shelters conduct an informative home check to ensure realistic expectations  The ‘Animal Welfare Report 2019  shows a high percentage of animal owners are not meeting the basic needs of their pets  This is harmful to their wellbeing  This could be reduced via education  home checks and the use of a cruelty database Stop utility companies from being able to discharge foul water into the rivers  other than in the infrequent times of heavy rainstorms  Additional Details  Utility companies are depositing more and more raw sewerage into UK rivers  Utility companies should have to upgrade/replace these pumping stations to accommodate the increase in connections from developments and ensure their modelling of the foul network has an allowance for misconnected surface water connection Forced adoption  or non consensual adoption  allows the UK government to put children up for adoption without parental consent This petition calls for the UK Government  to end its forced adoption policy   Consider consensual adoptions only and to reverse all such adoptions Additional Details  Punishment without crime must be eliminated from our legal system  Forced Adoption can cause life long pain and suffering  for the children and families involved Concerns around human rights  healthy development in forcibly adopted children and heightened trauma experienced by vulnerable parents has led to the majority of countries implementing consensual adoption practices Forced adoption has to end  It is emotional abuse  The Government should introduce legislation to require people with knowledge or suspicions of child sexual abuse to report this to the authorities  and make it an offence punishable by fines or a custodial sentence to fail to report or cover up suspected abuse  or facilitate a perpetrator Additional Details  I was sexually abused as a 13 year old and I am disgusted that many individuals and organisations assisted in keeping this quiet  New legislation could prevent this from happening again  and ensure that those who don t report suspected child abuse can be held accountable DfE to immediately allow overnight education trips for schools  subject to them risk assessing the trip whilst following the government advice in place and making informed decisions based on the actual venues  To allow pupils to attend in the same groups they already have contact with in school Additional Details  We believe current DfE guidance puts both the well being of pupils and the economic stability of the outdoor education sector into peril  There is already current government guidance on accommodation  travel and activities that would allow overnight educational visits to happen in a Covid secure and professionally managed environment  Children have missed enough of their education and this change would be invaluable in re engaging pupils back into education whilst nurturing their well being and mental health Extend the furlough scheme at 80percent for businesses who due to the covid19 pandemic are unable to operate or have limited capacity to operate and generate income due to the covid19 pandemic  Such as Hospitality  weddings  opticians  entertainment  health and beauty  travel and tourism Additional Details  If the furlough scheme is not extended at 80percent until at least December 2020 many businesses will have no choice but to make redundancies to keep from folding  which could lead to thousands possibly millions being unemployed and causing further economical damage as people will be unable to pay for basic necessities such as food and housing  This will damage the economy further as no one will be spending and could lead to a job crisis and take the country much longer to recover and rebuild Licensed breeders can rotate their breeding bitches  buying in pregnant bitches swapping them for whelped  Breeders can stay within their license at any one time and always have pregnant and whelping bitches  increasing litters dealt with and sold by 5 times the number of dogs on their license Additional Details  Animal welfare can be compromised when dogs can be swapped and change locations in order to give a breeder increased income  Some of these dogs can be provided by puppy mills and is easier than transporting puppies  which Lucy s Law has prevented  There remains this loophole in the law and this can be closed by including a limit on the number of litters a breeder can deal with or sell which is the same as the number of dogs stipulated on the licence  Making choosing a breeder clearer for pet owners Kristian Johnson was killed by a drink driver who was more than twice the legal limit  His killer was sentenced to 3 years for Causing Death by Careless Driving and is eligible for release from prison in 18 months  We want appropriate justice  Appropriate justice is a life sentence for these crimes Additional Details  Kristian s killer was convicted of causing death by  Careless Driving  rather than  Dangerous Driving    a crime which carries a maximum sentence of just 5 years  18 months in prison is not justice for killing someone and is unlikely to deter future drink driving  The sentence does not fit the crime  The impact to the lives of the victim s family is incomprehensible and a sentence of 18 months further damages the family  Kristian was 24  of good health and should have had a full life ahead of him  Instead it was cut tragically short  We are asking the Government to increase the maximum penalty to life sentences for death by careless driving as they promised in October 2017 and those convicted should serve a minimum of 15 years We want the Government to ensure continued access for schools to Erasmus Plus beginning with applications in 2021   The UK will need to have associated status in the programme  similar to Norway or Switzerland and to fund UK participation in courses  job shadowing and collaborative school projects Additional Details  Erasmus Plus is widely used by UK schools offering teachers international professional development and for pupils exposure to world languages and opportunities to work collaboratively  skills sought by employers  Activities are straightforward to arrange  the eTwinning programme also includes countries outside the EU where the UK will want to develop trade deals  A presence in this programme or replicating its principles and practices will help us achieve the Government s ‘Global Britain  goal To investigate whether prevention can be undertaken other than by primary legislation or by advice to Local Authorities that they absorb the costs Additional Details  Dated July 2020  The MHCLG published it summary of consultations and the governments`s response  Primary legislation does not include a power to prevent site owners from passing on annual or application fees to park home residents via the pitch fee  These costs should be borne by the industry  or by central government  where its predecessors failed to to ensure that rogue and criminal park owners were not afforded licenses and therefore facilitated their expansion   Collaterally  the planned change in England from the use of PRI to CPI will likely  cancel the benefit of that intended shiftThe Government should expand the British Nationality Act Remedial Order to cover the Windrush generation and their descendants  as they have historic rights to apply to become British citizens Additional Details  The Immigration Act 1971 gave the Windrush Generation rights to live and work in the UK  and secure British citizenship  but many faced difficulties availing themselves of these rights due to the hostile environment that was implemented subsequently  The Government should extend the British Nationality Act Remedial Order to cover the Windrush generation and their descendants  to remove potential barriers from their securing British citizenship Currently  only those that intend their victim to be distressed can be prosecuted  This excludes those that act for sexual gratification  financial gain  or to humiliate the victim  or those who are indifferent   Distress and embarrassment regardless of intent must be included to fill this gap Additional Details  The current legislation fails to protect those who have their intimate images shared without consent or knowledge because the intention was sexual and depraved as opposed to malice towards the individual  The criteria of the offence is half complete as consent is distinct but intentions are ambiguous  My private images were shared without consent during a seemingly trusting relationship  These were posted on indecent and pornographic websites to satisfy his sexual desire to degrade me online Form a Cross Party Government to enable a coherent response to the pandemic and guide the UK through it  When safe hold a General Election using Proportional Representation  Additional Details  The UK has one of the world s worst death rates  and the Government is using the pandemic to push through their policies   Brexit  NHS funding  Education  Employment etc    which many citizens don t support A cross party emergency Government should be established to respond to the pandemic  and then a general election should be held using PR  People should be able to vote for their preferred candidate   not second guess a tactical vote  The Government should require schools to offer all sports to all children so they get the opportunity to take a sport that they feel comfortable with  rather than being expected to take certain sports because of their gender  This should help tackle sexism and increase participation Additional Details  Many students are made to feel out of place in school sport  and cannot express their true selves when forced to do a sport just because of their gender  It also causes inequality as from day one students are defined by their gender  which can knock some people s self confidence  It is archaic that this still happens  and should not be allowed We would like the UK government to work with other countries and international bodies in brokering a resolution of the current conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia To ensure the immediate withdrawal of Armenian troops from Nagorno Karabakh and ensuring the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan Additional Details  As the UK is a major investor and beneficiary of the natural resources of Azerbaijan and an influential member in global politics  it has the ability to highlight the current dangerous escalation of violence and military action in the region This is significant as this could end with serious destabilisation in the region  it will cost lives and potentially end with both countries losing control of the current COVID 19 pandemic which could conclude with catastrophic consequences PLEVs / Mincromobilities are a solution for fast and clean transport  PLEVs are environmentally friendly and could reduce traffic congestion issues  These should legalized to be ridden where bicycles are legally allowed Additional Details  A new way to travel  Why PLEVs / Micromobility should be legal for public roads 1  They are environmentally friendly2  They could dramatically reduce traffic congestion issue3  Potential market of £150bUK is always been one of the leaders in innovations  we do not want to be left out on this modern way of transportation A survey of over 3 000 of riders across Europe found that electric bikes accounted for 38percent fewer insurance claims compared to pedal bike riders  on average Fund a scheme similar to that of the c card scheme  where those aged under 25 can receive free feminine hygiene products  via the use of a card  in places where the c card scheme is in operation Additional Details  I wish for the Government to take this step in order to tackle period poverty  and to allow people under 25 to live life without worrying about their periods or about finding money for sanitary products In light of what the Russian report has revealed  the Government should seek to extend the transition period and halt negotiations until there has been a full review into the Russian interference in the 2016 Referendum to leave the EU Additional Details  Given that the government failed to investigate possible interference in the referendum when there seemed to be evidence of potential interference on electoral and democratic events  it doesn t feel as though they have the country s best interest at heart  We believe the Government has been negligent  and that this has cast doubt over what the Government s intentions in terms of Brexit  and also Russian involvement in governmental processes We live in unprecedented times and more than ever the public need to know that what is said in the House of Commons is true and not an easily proved false statement  Increasingly we are seeing untruths as a deflection tactic Lying in the House of Commons should carry a prison sentence of 10 yearsAdditional Details  The Government should pass legislation to make the telling of demonstrable untruths in both the House of Commons and House of Lords a criminal offence The UK Government should seek to persuade governments of countries where bear bile farming takes place to outlaw and act to end this practice  Abuse of bears has no place in the modern world  and the UK Government should not stand by and do nothing in the face of such barbaric animal cruelty Additional Details  Bear bile is used in certain traditional medicines  but this does not justify the practice of bear bile farming  and research has shown that there are substitutes to bear bile The Draft Building Safety Bill currently proposes a Building Safety Charge payable by leaseholders for cladding remedial works  This should be removed and public funds made available to protect citizens through appropriate safety standards  and Freeholders should also be made to contribute Additional Details  Currently leaseholders are living in homes/flats which are unsafe  unsellable  and face paying for something which was not their fault  The government should take responsibility for failing to create and uphold appropriate fire safety standards and provide funds to make buildings safe and kick start the construction industry  Freeholders should also ultimately be responsible for removing this unsafe cladding Calls on the Secretary of State for Transport to reject the Development Consent Order for Highways England s proposals for Junction 10 of the A3/M25  Urges the Secretary of State to adopt the Alternative Scheme advocated by the RHS to protect the local environment and RHS Garden Wisley Additional Details  We believe the proposals from Highways England for Junction 10 of the A3/M25 are flawed because an Alternative has not been considered  and that the DCOs scheme unnecessarily threatens the environment including the future of RHS Garden Wisley  The proposals would put the RHS under huge financial burden  the increased journey time to the Garden could lose the RHS £6 6m during the construction period and lead to a loss of £19 2m over 10 years  The Garden risks the loss of 44 ancient trees on the boundary of RHS Wisley Everyone who can legally vote should have ID People want a fair and honest voting system  We feel this can only be achieved through a No ID no Vote system  this could eliminate fraudulent and double voting as well as unwanted outside voting intervention  Additional Details  We wish the government to make it law No ID No Vote system  Because it would prove once and for all that the government is a peoples government  it would help with a more honest approach to supporting that same government  a government protecting the peoples interest I would like the breast screening age to be lowered and offered to men  The screening programme says that it is more common for 50+ year olds to be diagnosed with breast cancer however I was 27 when diagnosed  I have had to undergo chemotherapy and will need surgery and radiotherapy Additional Details  Breast cancer does not only affect women over 50  it affects many women in their 20s  30s and 40s and they aren t offered screening unless there is a family history or an abnormality that they must find themselves  Men can also be affected by breast cancer so are equally entitled to screenings  Early detection could mean women have treatment at an earlier stage  and early action should prevent deaths and mean simpler treatment as it would be caught sooner Subsidise gym membership  group exercise and personal training to give more people access to health and fitness services and give a much needed economic boost to the leisure industry as part of a  work out to help out  campaign Additional Details  The leisure sector has waited the longest to reopen without any additional funding with many unable to reopen  yet the government is giving money off vouchers for fast food outlets such as McDonalds  KFC and Burger King as part of the  eat out to help out  campaign but prescribing cycling to tackle obesity as part of the  Better Health  campaign  There is an easier and more cost effective way to help businesses affected by coronavirus whilst tackling obesity PM Boris Johnson recently promoted the idea of including calorie counts on restaurant menus to tackle obesity   We  the undersigned  are asking that this does NOT happen  Calories are not a constructive way to determine full nutritional value  and we ask the government to consider other factors Additional Details  We believe including calorie counts on restaurant menus would be at the extreme mental and physical detriment of those suffering from eating disorders  which research suggests is somewhere between 1 25 and 3 4 million people in the UK alone  Calorie counts can promote food being seen as a  reward  that is  earned   which can encourage excessive exercise and potential binging/purging behaviours  Eating out should be a pleasurable and enjoyable experience  not one dominated by anxiety around eating  The Government to hold a referendum in Scotland on ending devolution and returning responsibility for devolved powers to the UK Government and Parliament Additional Details  For the first year  young drivers must have a black box fitted before they can drive  Furthermore  they should only be able to carry one passenger  who must be an experienced driver  These changes should significantly decrease the amount of young road crash fatalities by encouraging safer driving Additional Details  Last year  I lost my best friend Olivia Alkir in a road crash  Unfortunately  she was not the first or the last to face an early grave due to reckless and dangerous driving  which is far too common among young drivers  In 2018  777 car occupants were killed in road collisions  308 of whom  40percent  died in collisions involving a driver aged 17 24  I believe the changes I have proposed could prevent these disasters from happening to anyone else The current travel ban the USA imposed upon the UK has gone on far too long without any update  We the people require action  The Government should work with the USA to enable travel between our two countries  as they have with India  with protective measures  such as test on arrival and departure Additional Details  Family  partners and loved ones who are not married have been separated for too long  This is taking a massive toll on the mental health of citizens of both countries  Action needs to be taken now  We believe the ban is no longer needed as protections can reduce risk  As a UK citizen I implore my government to aid those suffering because #LoveIsNotTourism  My girlfriend lives in Illinois  Help us  help all of us  Take the first step in negotiations The Government should add alliums  onions  garlic  etc   to the list of allergens that must be listed and highlighted on food labels  in order to reduce the risk of anaphylactic shock and other serious reactions to foods Additional Details  Anaphylactic shock is incredibly dangerous and can be fatal  People with an allium allergy are not currently able to rely on food labels to determine whether something is safe to eat  Those with allium intolerance can suffer greatly with extreme and debilitating reactions and also face the same struggle of not knowing for sure whether something they buy is safe for them to eat The Honours Forfeiture Committee works in private and does not publish its decisions  The process must be made open and accountable  Additionally  recipients of honours who incite or encourage discrimination do not face automatic forfeiture  This must change Additional Details  Honours bestow credibility and prestige on individuals as a reward for bravery  achievement  or service to the UK  Some recipients later prove unworthy  To maintain confidence in the honours system  the Honours Forfeiture Committee should deliberate in public  and its decisions be published and subject to judicial review  Britain also prides itself on our laws against discrimination  and individuals who have incited or encouraged discrimination must be automatically stripped of their honours Campaign Against Antisemitism and others have long called for the regulation of social media  The #NoSafeSpaceForJewHate campaign arose due to social media companies  failure to remove hatred  The Government must bring an Online Harms Bill before Parliament during 2020 and make it law by July 2021 Additional Details  Racist material on social media has proliferated with little accountability  Social networks often do not provide evidence to police  and take little action themselves  as though they bear no responsibility for the hate they publish  This must end New legislation must urgently introduce a requirement to remove racist incitement within set timeframes  a duty of care for social networks with personal liability for executives  and tighter requirements to provide evidence to police under warrant The Government should abolish CAFCASS and fund alternative services to support families  eg Legal Aid  domestic abuse support  housing for victims of domestic abuse  and their children including older male children   etc Additional Details  In 2010 the Public Accounts Committee published a report which stated that CAFCASS was not fit for purpose  and in 2020 a Ministry of Justice assessment identified deep seated and systematic issues regarding court cases involving children  We believe that CAFCASS is not fit for purpose  should be abolished  and alternative services to support families be funded instead As measured on the McGill Pain Index  CRPS is one of the most painful conditions known  There is no cure  and it often gets misdiagnosed Additional Details  There needs to be more research for pain relief options and clear support and after care once diagnosed  Public awareness is helpful and also solid knowledge for NHS staff If the UK could follow other countries and contribute to more research into CRPS and the other issues it causes  thousands of lives could be improved  My quality of life since CRPS is drastically lower  There needs to be more support and awareness  A 3 pillar approach that links together  pain relief  mental health and physiotherapy  The timings of the pillars is crucial i e  physio after infusions  counselling ASAP  before you hit rock bottom and require the crisis team Air pollution damages our lungs  hearts and brains  causing 40 000 premature deaths and £20 billion in costs every year in the UK Additional Details   Burning fossil fuels is a major cause of both air pollution and climate change  It is a public right to understand the dangers of fossil fuels  just as it is for tobacco Emerging evidence suggests air pollution worsens covid19 outcomes  Health warnings connect the abstract threat of climate change with the vast array of health risks linked to fossil fuels  They should encourage use of alternatives to fossil fuels  and increase demand for zero carbon renewable energy  Making fossil fuel use more of a public concern should inspire improvements to cycling and public transport networks  car sharing  EV charging stations and city planning There appears to be an alarming rise in dogs imported after undergoing the inhumane procedure of having their ears mutilated  fulfilling the desire for a certain ‘look  and encouraging a procedure outlawed in England since 1899  It s time to close this 121 year old legal loophole Additional Details  Cropping a dog s ears is illegal in the UK  yet the numbers appear to be rising  An import ban could be possible under trade rules  There are companies that specifically import dogs with cropped ears for UK owners fuelling cruelty abroad  It s time to make imports illegal  raise awareness of the cruelty around cropped dogs and advise the public not to support companies/individuals that use cropped dogs in advertising and social media  as they re inadvertently promoting this painful practice In England  non cohabiting couples who have been following lockdown guidance have been unable to give each other a hug for four months  unless one member of the couple lives alone   This is not practical  carries heavy emotional and psychological cost and offers little hope as lockdown easing stops Additional Details  At the beginning of lockdown  couples were advised to test the strength of their relationship  and either move in or split up  For many couples moving in together is not possible  for practical  financial  or moral reasons  If lockdown rules are to be effective  they need to be able to be followed without damaging key relationships  Nor is it fair for those whose conscience is only comfortable following government guidance  In Scotland this is now allowed   it s time for England to do likewise  The Government should ban UK travel companies from selling tickets to all international attractions holding captive dolphins  whales or porpoises  excluding those solely for rehabilitation   There have been no captive cetaceans in the UK for over 25 years Additional Details  Whales  dolphins and porpoises are some of the most intelligent and emotionally aware animals  They should not spend their lives in concrete tanks  Captivity is a very damaging experience for cetaceans which often involves the separation of babies from mothers  wild capture and performing unnatural behaviours  This can lead to depression and even self harm  The only exclusion is when held solely for rehabilitation  with no shows or  swim withs   to be released to the wild or into sea pens Shooting of Badgers is licensed by Natural England as part of the DEFRA Badger cull  24 000+ Badgers were shot in 2019 Additional Details  Shooting is poorly monitored and Wild Justice believes it has never met the animal welfare standards recommended by a 2014 Independent Expert Panel  whose recommendations were accepted by DEFRA  This method of culling is inhumane and should be banned immediately This would open up Solar PV and battery storage up to more households  enabling more homes to save money on their electricity bills and earn revenue through the smart export guarantee as well as reducing their carbon footprint Additional Details  We believe the current grid and way we use energy is unsustainable  One way of addressing this is by reducing reliance on the grid  This is where Solar PV and battery will help  Spending now on reducing the reliance on the grid will save countless billions on upgrades We believe that welfare payments to polygamous families put a disproportionate strain on the taxpayer  and should be reviewed  Additional Details  Currently it is possible for polygamous families to claim certain benefits in respect of multiple wives  when they reside in the UK  We believe this is open to abuse and must be reviewed Extend the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme to September to give restaurants and cafes financial stability prior to a potential second wave of COVID 19 causing local/national lockdowns Additional Details  The government have the power and the responsibility to ensure people are not loosing their jobs due to businesses having a weak financial stability Home educated students need guaranteed access to suitable local examination centres at affordable prices  enabling them to have the same rights and access to qualifications as every other child in the UK Additional Details  Due to the uncertainty of COVID 19  examination centres are closing their doors to external candidates making it increasingly difficult for home educated students to gain qualifications  With many unable to obtain grades this summer  and the possibility of not being able to sit *any* exams this year coming  thousands of home educated students will miss out on college places and be unable to move on to the next step of their education or professional life without government intervention In the event of a spike we would like you not to close gyms as a measure to stop any spread of Covid  Also for gyms to not be put in the same group as pubs in terms of risk or importance  Gyms are following strict guidelines and most members are following rules in a sober manner Additional Details  The gyms are a huge benefit for users  not just physically but mentally too  There are studies that show physical exercise can be a great boost to the immune system and releases endorphins which can prevent stress and a chain of mental illnesses  In such a stressful time people need a viable way to exercise  Using home equipment just isn t sufficient  unless every person in the UK has hundreds of pounds to pay out on equipment  much of which has increased in price since the pandemic  I am calling for Parliament to include Sickle Cell Anemia as a listed illness eligible for a Medical Exemption Card Additional Details  There are 15 000 in the UK that suffer from a disease called sickle cell  The majority of whom are of Afro Caribbean decent  Although multiple medications for this illness are required daily  sickle cell sufferers have to pay for their prescriptions  This is medical racial injustice! No one should have to pay to stay alive  no one should have to pay for necessary medication The side effects of the contraceptive pill and other methods like the coil can be extremely damaging and range from anxiety  depression  strokes and heart attacks  Current forms of contraception can affect hormone balance which can cause a range of different issues  yet we have little to no options Additional Details  Contraceptive options are extremely limited and all come with different side effects that can have a negative impact on the body  Male contraceptive options haven t been made available because of unwanted side effects  so why is it ok for women to experience side effects  Action is needed to make contraception safer for everyone who uses it  as well as increase options for people without having to compromise other aspects of their health Currently  someone is only guilty of a sexual offence with an animal if there is full penetration  In Canada  for example  ANY contact for a sexual purpose between a person and an animal can be a criminal offence  The Government should recognise the weakness in the current law and change it Additional Details  Bestiality can be an indicator crime  and many offenders transfer the violence from animals to people  In the USA a study showed 31 6percent of animal sex offenders also sexually offended against children and adults  52 9percent had a prior or subsequent criminal record involving human sexual abuse  animal abuse  interpersonal violence  substances  or property offences  In the UK some  bestiality  cases are treated as an animal welfare offence only  No jail time and no referral to Sex Offender Programmes The Government should reform whistleblowing law to  require disclosures be acted upon and whistleblowers protected  with criminal and civil penalties for organisations and individuals failing to do so  establish an independent parliamentary body on whistleblowing  and provide easy access to redress Additional Details  We believe the Public Interest Disclosure Act fails to protect whistleblowers  the public and the public purse  It doesn t compel protection  nor ensure investigation of disclosures or correction of wrongdoing  It doesn t prevent cover ups  and gives inadequate redress after serious  irreparable harm  and can lead to wasteful  destructive litigation  Only 3percent of cases succeed at hearing  A new whistleblowing Bill by Dr Philippa Whitford MP contains several good practice elements which can inform debate on replacing PIDAThis petition is for the government to introduce a free evidence based appeals process  similar to the process currently under use in Scotland  for anyone disappointed with their 2020 exam results so that they may have more opportunity to progress to their next stages Additional Details  Following the IB and the SQA results  we have seen evidence that due to the new grading procedure  individuals have not received grades they feel are consistent with their work over the last two years  Without any appeals process  students in England could be forced to reapply for university/college or defer their entry   even if they have evidence that they feel goes against the grades they received Please sign the petition to allow any errors in grades to be appealed and to ensure greater fairness in the process The government should review the use of rawhide in dog treats and look at banning it as an ingredient  or at the very least ensuring that a clear warning of the dangers are displayed on all packaging of treats that use rawhide as an ingredient Additional Details  Many dog owners do not know the risks of rawhide products for their pets and due to this many have had their lives crushed by the devastating impact that it can have  Blockages  choking and contamination are all risks associated with rawhide  while some fight through  others aren t as lucky  Rawhide can contain toxic chemicals  although only in trace amounts this can still cause E  coli contamination and salmonella that even humans can be at risk when coming in to contact with said bacteria The Treasury has announced changes to Small Brewers Relief  SBR  – the progressive tax system that has revolutionised UK brewing  These changes will reduce the 50percent duty threshold from 5 000hl to 2 100hl  small breweries will have to pay more duty  whilst larger breweries could pay the same or less Additional Details  Those that will have to pay more do not know by how much as the consultation has been delayed until the Autumn  This is creating grave uncertainty for many small breweries at a time when the industry is trying to survive the Covid 19 crisis We believe the Treasury should not reduce relief for any brewers below 5 000hl and should reverse its decision to reduce the threshold to 2 100hl  and that these changes are threatening closures  innovation  competition  local jobs  investment and consumer choice The Government should take action to stop people entering this country illegally Additional Details  The taxpayer is footing the bill for costs associated with migrants who illegally enter the UK  The Government should take action to address the problem of illegal attempts to reach the UK The Government should review the Environment Agency decision to grant a license to install fish barriers and re examine the results of the 7 year study demonstrating the importance of Hoveton Great Broad to fish and wildlife in the Broads Additional Details  Angling is said to be worth over £100 million to the broads economy now at risk by these plans  I am concerned that the Heritage Lottery funding for the project appears to have been obtained on a false prospectus and due process not followed in the permitting decision with formal objections from Environment Agency fisheries experts seemingly disregarded and Water Framework Directive requirements potentially breached along with SAFFA s requirement on the EA to protect  enhance and improve freshwater fisheries  protect spawning fish and areas where fish spawn The Government should hold a referendum to remove the role of mayor of London and give these powers to a new London Assembly comprising of an elected representative from each London boroughAdditional Details  We believe the role of Mayor of London is vested with too much power for one person  that this is not in the best interests of the people of London  and that a new assembly with a chairperson/spokesperson would better represent Londoners This petition has been started with the intention of securing the safe return of non league/grassroots football to secure the future of football at a local level Additional Details  Non league football holds a special place in the community for young and old  the Government s unclear guidance has led to some clubs withdrawing from their leagues and a few folding all together  all because the Government hasn t made a clear enough decision regarding the start date of fans attending games  I request that all football below the national league north/south be allowed to return along side current government guidelines in terms of socially distancing and sanitation The DWP is checking its records to find women whose state pensions have been underpaid  but there are concerns these checks may not cover widows  older married women and the over 80s who may have be underpaid  DWP s search of its records must be comprehensive Additional Details  Under the old state pension  women could claim a pension based on the contributions of a husband  ex husband or late husband  DWP has acknowledged that in some cases this did not work and women are being underpaid  and is checking to find these women and compensate them  But others may be missing out  including widows  certain older married women and the over 80s  DWP must check their entitlements and provide compensation for any underpayment  rather than wait for them to claim  one by one Change UK law to allow police forces to release video recorded on officers  body cams to media outlets  and via their Social Media  at a senior officer s discretion  The general public may make video recordings of police and publish them immediately  our police forces should have the same right Additional Details  Heavily edited recordings of their interactions with police are increasingly being published by members of the general public A process needs to be introduced whereby UK police forces may take the decision to release unedited body cam footage of an incident to both Mass Media outlets  and their own Social Media This process would allow forces to counteract  sometimes highly misleading video footage  being widely distributed with the primary intent of damaging the reputation of their officers Revert final exam grades back to teacher s predictions instead of forcing students to keep the standardised ones which exam boards have unfairly given based on the postcode in which a student lives  This will benefit students greatly and put many minds at ease in these already stressful times Additional Details  Final grades have been determined on the area in which a student resides  meaning many have been downgraded unfairly  even in this stressful situation  Standardisation of results has been prioritised over students  true performance standard  which teachers have a good knowledge of  It is outrageous that final grades have been altered to fit the area over a student s true capability  which could have a huge impact on the emotional state of many We want the government to highlight  promote and support the importance of creating pollinator networks nationwide  A super highway for pollinators that connects landscapes ward by ward  borough by borough  county by county and region by region  thus building a network of habitats for pollinators Additional Details  A third of British wild bees and pollinators are in decline  If current trends continue  some species will be lost from Britain indefinitely Pollination is mutually beneficial to plants and pollinators  Pollinators are an essential component of the habitats and ecosystem that we and many animals rely on for food  shelter and well being  This network  The Bee Superhighway  will foster that and help the long term sustainability of food production and wildlife livelihood and we must encourage it In 2021 the Government should immediately end any suspension of the 80 20 rule  It should also have put in place new legislation setting local criteria for distributing slots that will incentivise inward investment  connectivity and social responsibility Additional Details  Legacy carriers should not have their market dominance protected by law  no matter how they behave nor how this hurts the interests of  UK airline customers and UK workers   In January 2021 the UK can set its own slots rules  The current system allows legacy national carriers to monopolise the most profitable ‘slots   This was once justified by such carriers being focused on high quality service and providing good  well paid jobs  We believe that this argument no longer holds We want longer sentences to be given to people who commit or incite crimes towards children  From physical harm to mental harm  molestation  grooming  manipulation  rape  exploitation and more Additional Details  We want this changed as we believe current sentencing is not strict enough  These are the most evil of crimes and a child is the most innocent of victims A child must be protected and be safe  Too many offenders have short sentences and go on to re offend  Justice is not served for all the children affected by adults who commit crimes against children  who are our future  They need protected and current sentences fail to do this Increasing sentences should keep offenders off the streets and away from our children! Being abused causes many life long issues that do not allow a person to heal and justice is needed to those who have suffered at a bare minimum I am calling on the Government to fund local councils to improve bridleway routes by upgrading appropriate footpaths to create links  either permanently or through seasonal permissive routes  and ensuring there is safe access to current bridlepaths where access has been lost Additional Details  No one wants horses on roads Not drivers  not riders  not horses  It s dangerous  not relaxing and it s horses and riders who pay the price with their lives The British Horse Society figures show that Nov 2010   Mar 2019 there were 3 737 incidents reported  315 horses and 43 riders were killed on our roads during this time But if riders want to ride out there is little choice  There are some fantastic  bridlepaths but the quiet country lanes have become shortcuts for busy commuters and most riders do not have the funds or access to transport to take their horses to forests or private grounds Amid upcoming presidential elections  we have seen the harassment and detention of thousands of people  including independent journalists  social media actors  human rights defenders and peaceful protestors  The UK Government should condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms Additional Details  The United Kingdom as a prime example of modern democracy often stands firm against breaches of human rights and freedom  and must do so in this instance by condemning the arbitrary harassment and detention of citizens Dogs  cats and Live Stock are increasingly being attacked by out of control dogs resulting in trauma and death  Increase and include compulsory penalties for dog attacks and attempted attacks on other animals  Provide pet dogs with the same rights under the dangerous dog act as assistance dogs Additional Details  Dogs are being killed by other dogs both on and off leads due to their owners being unable to control them To ensure that the grade boundaries in the autumn term A level exams are lowered considering a global pandemic  school closures and the failure of the Government relating to the A level result catastrophe Additional Details  Due to the fiasco of the A level grading this year where some people have entered university on centre assessed grades  some people have lost out and are going to have to sit the exam   This process is completely and utterly unfair for some people that have no choice for this as an option   Therefore  the grade boundaries need to be lowered  considering any studying now for the exam is independent and not school based  we have been now given less than two months to revise and prepare Change the law to ensure highways workers are afforded the same level of protection against abuse as emergency workersAdditional Details  Rates of abuse from members of the public towards highways workers are alarmingly high  The subject is largely ignored and only by the stiffening of penalties can we really effect positive changeThe Government should change its guidance on guidance for the safe use of places of worship during the pandemic to allow corporate worship and congregational singing at places of worship Additional Details  The guidance on permitted activities in places of worship is much stricter than for some other activities  such as sporting events  This is unfair  and limits how people attending places of worship can participate in religious activities  The Government should review this guidance  We believe corporate worship is essential to what we do as believers We want Police Officers to be able to provide a suspension notice from the moment an offender is caught drink  drug or dangerous driving until they appear in court  It would then be for the Judge to decide whether a ban continues or they are able to continue to drive again Additional Details  On 24th February 2019 Tom McConnachie was killed in a hit and run by a drink driver who left Tom fatally injured in the road and drove to Okehampton and set fire to the vehicle  The offender was able to continue driving for 11 months before being disqualified as only a court can disqualify a driver  With Tom s Law we want Police Officers to be able to issue a suspension notice to an offender when arrested at the Road side to stop them from driving until they attend court to protect other Road users Suffering leaseholders have endured endless consultations and years of failed reforms  Government must fulfil the promises made in 2017 to legislate to 1  BAN leasehold houses2  Restrict all ground rents on new leases to ZERO3  Enact ALL of the Law Commission proposalsAdditional Details  The evidence is clear  Leasehold law is flawed  Failure to enact the Law Commission s recommendations and banning leasehold houses and setting future ground rents to ZERO is a failure to fix the broken housing marketThe Law Commission proposals are about “making our homes ours  rather than someone else s assets” Prof Nick Hopkins  Law Commissioner“Justice delayed is Justice denied”  Robert Jenrick  July 2020 GOVERNMENT MUST FULFIL THEIR PROMISELeaseholders deserve more than empty promisesThe government should allow BTEC students to achieve teacher predicted grades rather than being forced into a system that is unethically downgrading thousands of students grades Additional Details  To allow fairness to all Students within the education systemThe 250 year old Cubbington Pear tree in Warwickshire  is the 2nd largest in the country and is due to be cut down in September 2020 to make way for HS2  In 2015 it was voted England s ‘tree of the year   Reroute the railway  or at least see if the tree can be safely moved out of the route s way Additional Details  This is part of our heritage and is a tree of national importance  The story has made it to national media and there is public support to save the Cubbington pear tree The law allows someone who is involved is a serious or fatal car crash to leave the scene  and report the accident later   I would like people who are involved in fatal accidents and drive off  leaving the victim injured or dead to receive life sentences to stop them driving offAdditional Details  The law Needs to be changed so that any person involved in a serious or fatal accident has to stop and stay at scene and report straight away to help the injured on the road or they revive the maximum sentence for life for leaving a person to die on road  At present the British law acts as an incentive for law braking drivers to flee the scene of the kill someone  I want the sentence to be a deterrent from other drivers doing this and maybe we will be able to save lives on the roadThe time limitations for bringing a claim against a manufacturer of mesh  essure sterilisation and breast implants should be removed  It can take years for patients to develop symptoms and for clinicians and regulators to become aware of a problem  This means many miss the deadline to claim Additional Details  To make a claim against the manufacturer under the Consumer Protection Act you have to be within 3 years of knowing or that there was a problem with the medical device  Although this limit can be extended at the discretion of the court  there s a maximum of 10 years from when a particular device was manufactured  Some don t find out their problems are attributable to the device until many years down the line  after being investigated for other medical conditions that they simply do not have  Ladies have lost families  homes and jobs  all destroyed by a device they had been led to believe to be safe  How can the law for implants be the same for devices like your kettle  The time limit for bringing a claim against the manufacturer of implanted medical devices should be removed In 1831  an innocent young man was convicted and hanged  despite overwhelming doubt surrounding the case against him  We call upon the government to put right a wrong that has existed for 189 years Additional Details  O Arglwydd  dyma gamwedd    O Lord  this is injustice   Were the final words of Dic Penderyn  before being executed for a crime he didn t commit  the stabbing and wounding a soldier in the skirmishes between the starving workers of Merthyr Tudful and armed soldiers sent in to quell the Merthyr Rising of 1831  A key witness later admitted to lying under oath then the real assailant confessed to the crime on his death bed  189 yrs on  the original injustice is perpetuated by the lack of a pardon  Anti homeless architecture includes street spikes  slanted/curved benches  armrests on benches  barred corners  rocky pavements etc  These make life harder and more dangerous for the homeless and rough sleepers  Parliament must ban anti homeless architecture to protect the safety of rough sleepers Additional Details  Since 2010 rough sleeping has more than doubled  Overall  an estimated 320 000 people are homeless in the UK  with approximately 4 000 to 5 000 people bedding down each night  In 2018 alone  726 people died while homeless  Yet councils respond to this by erecting anti homeless architecture around the country  This is unethical  The government is only making it harder for already vulnerable people to find a safe space to spend the night  Ban anti homeless architecture Consider extending the furlough scheme for those industries still being affected  The travel industry for example is still directly affected by decisions the government is making in regard to travel restrictions and quarantine which is preventing us from trading properly Additional Details  Whilst many industries are now able to trade either fully or partially  the travel industry is being disproportionately affected by travel restrictions and quarantines being imposed by the government  Many people have spent their lives working in the industry and once all this is over  those skilled employees will be once again required to plan and take the nation on holiday  Whilst restrictions remain in place  imposed by the government we cannot trade fully or make a recovery Schools should move to online learning from 9 December so that all students and school staff have a chance to isolate for two weeks and then can safely meet older relatives Additional Details  We need to be able to look forward to family celebrations at the end of a difficult year  There will be so many lonely grandparents if measures aren t taken to allow households to mix safely  There will be many very risky meetings which could lead to unnecessary pressure on the NHS Put pressure on world leaders including the United Nations and UNICEF to investigate the mass incarceration of Uighur Muslims and urge sanctions on China  Additional Details  Under human and amnesty rights laws their rights to be Muslims and practice freely are being violated  I want this highlighted immediately so Uighurs can return home UK government stands against all forms of oppression  It fights for the freedom and rights of every citizen  It allows Muslims to practice freely  Islam stands for peace and UK recognises the strong bond UK Muslims have with diverse communities here  We are grateful for this  UK stood up for the black lives matter campaign with great success  now I believe UK government can truly put an end to the blatant indoctrination of Uyghur Muslims because in the past they have united against oppression Allow learner drivers to be passed if their driving instructors feels they are safe to drive due to the failure of the Government to enable learners to book a test Additional Details  It is unfair on learners who have been unable to book a test due to the pandemic to have to wait a significantly long time to be have access to booking one You can t go into a supermarket and steal your weeks groceries  There are laws in place to protect shop keepers large and small  Not paying rent is also theft with the Landlord being the victim  In Australia  tenants can be evicted for being 14 days in arrears with rent  Lets have that system here Additional Details  The current system is unfair to Landlords  If a Tenant doesn t pay rent then it can take a year for Landlord to regain procession  In that time the Landlord still has to pay mortgage and other costs  This can ruin many small scale Landlords  Further more  it incentives Landlords to only rent their properties to tenants with higher than average income who are likely to care about getting a bad credit rating  Lets have an Australian style system which aims to be nutral between Landlord and Tenant Update planning laws to allow for environmentally friendly  low impact and sustainable homes to be built in England more easily  thus letting people live with less impact on the environment  This has been done with the one planet development policy in Wales and the crofting legislation in Scotland Additional Details  The current housing crisis and worsening climate crisis are both problems facing us currently  The movement for low impact and sustainable dwellings  like those allowed by the Welsh one planet development policy and Scottish Crofting Commission are helping to reduce both of these issues  The current  outdated legislation in England makes it difficult to build low impact dwellings with sustainable materials  ultimately resulting in environmental damage and a potentiation of the housing crisis Raise the UK state pension to match the UK minimum wageThe UK national pension is not enough to live on!Additional Details  Some pensioners have had their private pensions stolen or badly invested and others could just not afford to pay for a private pension Either way the majority have paid into the state pension as National Insurance contributionsWhen we reach retirement and claim the basic pension it is only worth approximately £6981 per annum and by the governments calculations the minimum a person needs to live on is £16325 which is the minimum living wageRaise the state pension to match the minimum wage!I call upon the Government to establish a peoples scientific and medical panel to scrutinise the scientific and medical advice that is given to the Government   This panel will contain bona fide  qualified medical and scientific professionals and will be selected by the people Additional Details  I am concerned by conflicting messages regarding the current pandemic  Through everyday conversation and viewing various social media platforms  I can see that I am not alone in my concerns  People feel they are not hearing the full spectrum of information available  We feel let down by the media who provide information which can be confusing or contradictory The debate and discussion must be opened up  There are many questions that need to be asked and answered Ministers should urgently change the law to make sprinklers compulsory in all new build and refurbished schools as is the case in Scotland and Wales   Investing in sprinklers is a small price to pay for improving the resilience of the school estate and protecting young people s education Additional Details  Schools could be almost twice as likely to be hit by a fire as other non residential buildings  according to research by the insurer Zurich  Unlike Scotland and Wales  there is no legal requirement in England for sprinklers to be fitted in new build and refurbished schools   With Government data showing almost 2 000 school blazes over the last three years  this is costing taxpayers millions of pounds  harming children s education  and potentially putting lives at risk Pass a law to ensure only UK residents are able to apply for legal aid  This would stop tax payers money being used to represent people who are not UK residents Additional Details  Hammersmith bridge is now shut to pedestrians as well as vehicles and cyclists it s impacting on many lives  We need the government to step in a fix the bridge  or build a new one and we need a temporary one to allow pedestrians and cyclists to get across Additional Details  School children can t get to their schools easily either side now  workers are unable to get across it s an additional 30 60 mins on people s journeys  The pollution and traffic has risen in barnes  putney and Fulham due to re routed traffic  Local businesses are going under as footfall has died  The hospital is no longer accessible in emergencies  The government needs to step in to support the local community and councils Scrap fines/punitive measures and provide assistance for households with at risk and vulnerable members who are not willing to send their children to school due to Coronavirus transmission concerns Additional Details  The return of children to school in the upcoming term should not have to be a potentially life and death choice for their family  It is grossly unfair to consider punishing families with vulnerable members regarding the return of children to school  Other measures should be made available to the children of such families as they were when lockdown began such as remote learning  Please do the  right thing  Given the dire situation the theatre industry is in we call on the Government to review the continued imposition of social distancing in indoor theatres as soon as possible  and on a regular basis thereafter should it need to remain in force  and well before the currently stated timeline of NovemberAdditional Details  The theatre industry is benefiting from the culture bail out but that sum cannot do more than help some venues and organisations survive the current closure  The decision not to review social distancing until November is adversely affecting recovery chances and jeopardising thousands of jobs and many venues  The rationale for keeping theatres closed for months longer must be properly debated and speedier consideration needs to be given to the possibility of lifting social distancing in theatres Commit to testing for cervical cell changes  regardless of the HPV result  With the latest changes  if you do not have high risk HPV  your sample will not be looked at for cell changes  This will without a doubt increase cervical cancer deaths and later stage diagnosis Additional Details  Myself and a number of other women I know had HPV negative smear tests with cell changes that turned out to be cervical cancer  Had we only been tested for HPV and sent away for 3 5 years  we would not have survived To tackle the ever growing backlog of candidates waiting to take driving tests  it is vital that the DVSA immediately open all test centres to full capacity and post examiners back to the test centres that need them  Social distancing between examiners can be achieved by staggering the test times Additional Details  The growing backlog is mostly due to the DVSA reducing the capacity of many local test centres and posting examiners to other centres many miles from where candidates live and learned to drive  The booking system crashed on 21st Aug  and there was a queue of over 100 000 people when it reopened on 26th Aug  It is also putting strain on the customer service call centres who are dealing with daily queues of up to 3 hours long  Many people need their driving independence for work and some candidates have had their test on hold since March The Government should review the decibel limit on over the counter fireworks  and reduce this to a lower limit that will preserve the health and safety of the public by reducing possible noise induced hearing damage as well as giving respite to pets and those suffering from PTSD Additional Details  The current limit is 120 dB  but noise above 70 dB over a prolonged period of time may start to damage your hearing  and loud noise above 120 dB can cause immediate harm to your ears  The Government should determine a sensible  lower decibel limit for fireworks that can be sold over the counter to the public We reject all of the UK Governments proposals outlined in their Consultation document from Aug 28th 2020 that proposes changes to Human Medicine Regulations to support the roll out of COVID 19 vaccines that would simplify the temporary authorisation  supply  use and promotion of unlicensed products Additional Details  We reject this because we believe allowing these changes to go ahead will cause much more harm than good  More information at https //www gov uk/government/consultations/distributing vaccines and treatments for covid 19 and flu/consultation document changes to human medicine regulations to support the rollout of covid 19 vaccines In light of the latest Sage reports  I am asking the Government to guarantee there will be no second national lockdown or reimposing of other restrictions this winter Additional Details  The national lockdown that began in March this year has been devastating to the UK  Not only have treatments for cancer and other serious illnesses been paused  with potentially fatal consequences   but people s livelihoods have been severely damaged with the blanket shutdown of the economy  Furthermore  the mental wellbeing of the nation has suffered  Considering the current low death rate  we believe a second lockdown would be a massive overreaction leading to further economic devastation Ensure that PIP applications are completed fairly by appropriately trained medical staff by government agencies  Ensure that decision makers  awarding PIP are accountable  Reintroduce lifetime awards where appropriate  Ensure decisions are correct the first time they are made Additional Details  The PIP process is unfair  traumatic and inhumane  denying disabled people their rights and putting them at financial risk  It affects their mental health and puts them through months of distress  It overwhelms the court system when incorrect decisions need to be challenged  It wastes taxpayers  money when decisions are reviewed  and lines the pockets of private companies  We believe that Centre Assessment Grades  CAGs  do not in all cases reflect the actual ability or likely attainment of many students  and there are also concerns that that the CAG system has negatively impacted BAME students and those from more disadvantaged backgrounds Additional Details  The Government should change A level grades from CAGs to  predicted grades provided to UCAS  where these were higher Halal and kosher meat must be intended for consumption by Jews or Muslims  but we believe this requirement is too vague and open to misuse producers who use religious slaughter methods  and results in excess meat being slaughtered in this way and passed on without labelling Additional Details  The Government should require that meat slaughtered religiously should only be for consumption by Jews or Muslims  and that all halal and kosher meat is labelled clearly at the point of retail  both at shops and eateries  so that all consumers are able to choose whether to purchase meat that has been slaughtered in this way Extend the SEISS scheme for self employed travel professionals   The SEISS was designed to protect the self employed adversely affected by coronavirus   The FCO advice remains against all but essential international travel and until this changes our businesses will be adversely affected Additional Details  The Travel Industry is facing extremely challenging times   Even after lock down  travel advice remains against all but essential international travel   There have been exemptions to this advice but with changes to these exemptions confidence in travelling is now at an all time low!  When people begin to travel again expert help and advice will be needed more than ever to protect and guide travellers in the post Covid19 world Welfare services provided by regulated social care companies are exempt from VAT  This means that we do not charge VAT on services to the most vulnerable  However  current VAT rules mean we cannot reclaim VAT on business expenses  We are seeking a review so the sector becomes zero rated for VAT Additional Details  The social care sector plays a vital role in supporting the over stretched healthcare system and is operating under increasing financial pressure  This petition aims to create a viable financial model for providers to operate in that will help to future proof our sector so that we can continue to provide our vital services in domiciliary care  care home and community settings Providers are committed to reinvesting VAT savings back into their businesses to benefit clients and carers Unpaid trial shifts are open to exploitation as they can be used by unscrupulous employers to take advantage of vulnerable people looking for a job  Often unpaid trials are for minimum wage jobs and the people applying for them cannot afford to work for free but may have no other option Additional Details  Potential employees might feel as though they can t say no to these exploitative trials without risking their future livelihood  It is unfair to force someone to work for hours without pay for a job they might not even be given  Moreover  there is the cost of travelling to and from the trial shift as well as having to buy a uniform such as a shirt  trousers  plain t shirt etc  These are things that unemployed people cannot afford to be wasting money on and shouldn t have to for a job that is unpaid The Government should be responsive to global calls for artefacts to be returned to their place of origin  and should amend the British Museum Act 1963 to allow the Trustees of the British Museum to consider and potentially facilitate their repatriation Additional Details  The British Museum Act 1963 does not permit the Trustees to dispose of any artefacts  save in a small number of special circumstances   even following reasonable repatriation requests   The Trustees should be permitted by law to act with greater freedom and flexibility in recognising the educational and historical value and cultural enrichment of outstanding artefacts  such as the Parthenon sculptures and Benin Bronzes  and in returning them to their place of origin  Call on the government to consider holding debates in Parliament between MPs and university students to raise/discuss issues that affect them  It will allow students to voice their opinions and concerns about tuition fees of £9250 a year which are too high  particularly as grants have been removedAdditional Details  Higher education is the key for our nation s future  live Parliament debates involving MPs and students are crucial to give them the opportunity to raise the issues of concern in particular reducing University student fees and other matters impacting their lives including accommodation costs  The debates should include university students  post graduates  those from poorer backgrounds and disabilities also college students  Covid 19 has left the nation s future economy/job market uncertainNow the hedgehog has been listed as vulnerable to extinction in the UK  we are calling on the Government to move hedgehogs to schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to allow them greater protection Additional Details  This change will mean hedgehogs will be afforded greater protection and hopefully help their numbers recover Extend the parameters of the building safety fund for non ACM cladding  To treat everyone fairly by including under 18m buildings  to broaden the scope and funding to include wood balconies  wooden walkways  compartmentalisation issues and fund historical fire safety work Additional Details  To support those in multi storey buildings under 18m  with the same equality as all high rise buildings Current restrictions permit max  30 guests at a wedding including suppliers  DJ  photographers and officiant etc  This petition asks that the limit be reviewed and raised for example if guests prove negative for a COVID 19 test prior to the wedding and engage in isolation measures until such time Additional Details  There is a stark contrast in the way bars  pubs restaurants operate compared to that of a wedding despite being very similar eg multiple people in one space  socially distanced with music  food and drinks  Multiple Individuals  capacity permitting  can remain in a pub for the duration of the day without much limitation apart from distancing  whereas a wedding is heavily restrained with a cap on guests  activities and time limits in cases  Please can this balance  especially on guests be reviewed Extending the Stamp Duty Holiday for an additional 6 months will assist many buyers who are looking to move to a property that they will not be able to afford otherwise This will help to stabilise the housing marketAdditional Details  I am looking to move into a new build which is currently due to complete at the start of March 2021  If this build is delayed past 31st March 2021 then i will not be able to afford the stamp duty so will not be able to afford the house The IndyWales movement has gained many supporters and followers recently  Many people support an independent Wales  Let Welsh people have a referendum and make the choice Additional Details  Pass legislation to make null and void any non disclosure agreements or gagging orders  irrespective of when entered into  when related to covid 19  sars cov 2   and to protect any staff who speak out  Apply to all current and former employees  directly or indirectly employed by the NHS Additional Details  The Coronavirus  sars cov 2  pandemic has had profound implications on society in the UK  and on the NHS  NHS staff  either presently employed or previously employed  have a wealth of experience to learn from  There should be no barriers to NHS staff  present or former  direct or indirect  to freely speak out  to enable lessons to be learnt from this pandemic  Furthermore this should not be done when the dust settles   but now  when there is still time to make a difference  We want the government to fund free meals for vulnerable children in early years settings  Currently disadvantaged children in schools have access to free meals  but there are vulnerable children in early year childcare settings who do not receive the same support Additional Details  Younger children in childcare settings appear to have been left out by the Government s policy on free meals  In the current climate  when many families are facing hardship  the Government needs to ensure vulnerable children in early years settings have their basic needs met  by funding free meals for these children  All children have the right to have their basic needs met!We request that the Government proposes a ban on supertrawlers from UK waters after the UK becomes an Independant Coastal State and is no longer restricted by the EU s Common Fisheries Policy  CFP  which allowed these huge vessels to decimate fish stocks and endanger marine ecosystems and species Additional Details  Supertrawlers are factory sized fishing vessels over 100m which trail nets a mile long catching thousands of tonnes of fish including bycatch and protected species including cetaceans Foreign owned supertrawlers are regularly decimating the UK s fish stocks and endanger protected marine species In 2019 such vessels fished in 39 of the UK s marine protected areas  while in the first six months of 2020 a total of 23 supertrawlers  mostly Dutch and Russian  fished in 19 marine protected areas Remove under 12s from calculations of group size in relation to coronavirus regulations  This will prevent families being discriminated against Additional Details  Amend legislation to include an exemption for under 12s when calculating group sizes Recently  COVID cases has spiked back up again  the numbers showing that there has been an increase  We need to have a second full Lockdown to ensure that COVID isn t a threat again  We need implement safer and tighter restrictions again as this helped a couple months ago Additional Details  Schools have implemented social distancing but it is not that safe as we are still sitting in small classrooms in big numbers  In lining up  students are still very close to each other and during lunch  students have to sit next to each other  Schools aren t taking enough precautions  In spring  when lockdown was first implemented it seemed very effective  We had to stay at home unless very necessary which helped the cases go down  Also  flu season is coming up and many people can easily catch it and become severely ill As a teacher  I can t praise the support staff enough! They really are an asset to schools and I feel if schools had more funding  you would see better results both academically and when dealing with well being and behaviour of the children Additional Details  I would love for support staff to get the credit they deserve  I would appreciate the help and support in such a time consuming and tough job  Even more so since we re now catching up on missed schooling Close down schools and colleges due to the increase in COVID 19 cases  We are seeing cases of students and teachers catching the virus since schools have reopened Additional Details  To protect teachers and pupils and their families The digital divide between care leavers and the rest of society is growing  Care leavers are at risk of not being able to prosper in life due to the lack of support provided by their corporate parent to stay digitally connected when moving in to independent living Additional Details  Call to ensure care leavers are digitally connected We are calling on government to  	Extend and improve uptake of the government scheme that provides digital devices  and internet for care leavers 	Ensure every care leaver in England has a digital device and internet access for at least 12 months when they first live independently  	Recommend that all local offers for care leavers include the right to a digital device and internet accessHundreds of thousands of leaseholders are trapped in their homes facing bankruptcy from life changing bills for waking watches  alarms and fire safety remediation  We want Government to protect them by implementing the Select Committee s  Cladding  progress of remediation  report recommendations Additional Details  Recommendations include but are not limited to   Increasing the Building Safety Fund to address all fire safety defects in every high risk residential building  Providing funding for interim fire safety measures  such as waking watches and fire alarms  Ensuring those responsible for the crisis contribute to the fund  Use of CPO powers to take direct ownership of the freehold of buildings with serious fire safety defects  Putting in place a much faster  fairer system than the EWS1 processThe Government should give UK voters the opportunity to vote on whether they want the Government to open negotiations on re joining the European Union Additional Details  The nature of UK s European Union departure now seems unrecognisable from the promises of the Vote Leave campaign  Promises made in 2016 have not and cannot be delivered  The Government now is proposing a version of Brexit that I don t think anyone voted for  This is an affront to democratic norms  A second referendum is long overdue following a catalogue of broken promises  UK voters now finally deserve to have another say We believe that the Government s response to Covid 19 has been disproportionate and not adequately balanced the risks posed by Covid against significant harm including deaths that are not Covid related Additional Details  We need a cross party  cross discipline panel that includes social scientists and human rights and legal experts to scrutinise Covid 19 policies before they are implemented and consider whether the impact of proposals on availability of the NHS  non Covid deaths  human rights and peoples mental health are proportionate  Our mum spent three weeks in hospital without family to comfort her in a state of high anxiety due to strict no visiting policy  She later died of cancer  Strict policies deprived people like our mum of their civil liberties and can cause poor health outcomes and excess deaths that could even outweigh risks from Covid 19 The Government should review its travel corridor list and advice for travel to African countries  in line with the same metrics used for the rest of the world  If metrics of cases per 100k and testing levels were used  this could enable travel to Eastern and Southern Africa  to start with Additional Details  1  Humanitarian  The African continent relies heavily on international travel for £130bn income and 25m jobs  Each African travel job typically supports 8 10 dependents  helping to support up to 250m people across Africa 2  Wildlife  More eyes on the ground in Africa should reduce poaching or rhino  elephant and pangolin and subsistence killing of animals for bush meat 3  UK Jobs  Protect UK jobs across tour operators  travel agents  tourist boards  airlines  marketing and PR companies Price rises and a lack of pool time could see a number of swimming clubs close  As a result of the coronavirus pandemic  pool hire costs have increased in many areas and pool time has become extremely limited Additional Details  Due to the current COVID 19 situation and the restrictions which remain in place many providers are under huge financial pressure  Swim England have stated that 44 swimming clubs in total have had substantial price rises by one provider alone  Amateur swimming is under threat  Swimming benefits young people in so many ways  from tackling obesity to improving mental health  For example  according to Swim England  swimming saves the NHS £357m every year  It would be a monumental shame if swimming became one of leisure s ‘forgotten activities   Who is going to win gold medals for Great Britain at the Olympics if swimming is gone  Please let us keep swimming  by supporting swimming clubs during Covid 19 Anyone caught desecrating a war memorial in the UK should be imprisoned  It is unacceptable Additional Details  Ensure that the recent restrictions of social gatherings to six individuals from different households also extend to outdoor activities including the hunting and shooting of grouse  foxes  and other animals Additional Details  This is a time of national crisis  when everyone s personal freedoms have been necessarily limited  It is therefore entirely unacceptable that special provisions be given to particular pastimes and leisure purists  COVID 19 doesn t distinguish between 30 people gathered to hunt grouse  and 30 people gathered to play and watch football  rugby  ultimate frisbee  quidditch or any other sport The government should ensure that all groups abide by the rules  Only then will this crisis be averted The 2010 NICE guidelines recommend that patients with suspected HF should be reviewed by a specialist   within 2 weeks for urgent cases  Patients are presently waiting up to 20 weeks for specialist assessment  Additional Details  The Government should ensure that this recommended right to a review within 2 weeks is set out in law Many heart failure patients have poor outcomes  with 1 and 5 year mortality rates worse than some of the most common cancers In 2010 it became a legal right of NHS patients with suspected cancer to be seen by a hospital doctor within 2 weeks of a GP referral We request that NICE quality standards are implemented with the same vigour as they are in cancer  and for the government to legislate that high risk patients with suspected heart failure are seen by a specialist within 2 weeks of referral The Government  through the NIHR  must ringfence funds to create a Challenge Study Center with sufficient biocontainment capacity to quarantine 100 200 volunteers in COVID 19 human challenge trials Additional Details  We need multiple vaccines to meet global demand  and some epidemiologists are considering COVID 19 human challenge trials to quickly narrow the field of promising vaccine candidates  Over 1 400 Britons have already volunteered  In the past  the government has provided funding for clinical trial centers during times of need  Today  the government should embrace the altruism of British volunteers and cement the UK s leadership in future medical research by doing the same Allow families to homeschool without losing their child s school place during the pandemic  Parents/guardians who can provide a satisfactory plan to educate their children at home  in instances where there are no safeguarding concerns  should be permitted to do so Additional Details  Parents/guardians  particularity those in the at risk category  should not be in the position where they either send their child to school or lose their place  Many families have extra health concerns and should be allowed the option to homeschool temporarily during the pandemic  This would free up extra space for the children who do need to go to school to social distance  It is unacceptable to force children to go to school when the personal and societal risks are currently unquantifiable Provide funding and work to create more effective procedures between relevant Charities  NHS  Police  Social services and any other agency to ensure survivors of trauma receive the correct treatment and care including psychotherapyAdditional Details  As a survivor of rape I have witnessed the flaws in the current system  where there is no clear procedure or cooperation between organisations  This has worsened my condition on many occasions and I do not want others to suffer like I have The UK is dealing with two major challenges which should be considered as much more important than any  party politics  Additional Details  By forming a  Government of National Unity   a government of all parties could focus on Covid 19 and Brexit The UK currently faces the two biggest challenges of the century  Covid 19 and Brexit I feel that the current government is failing on both fronts  and  party politics  seems to be turning our Parliament into some sort of school playground A Government of National Unity could be a huge benefit to this nation The government is put in power by the people for the people  On such a controversial issue such as coronavirus measures  the government cannot take the freedom of the UK population away without consulting with them first  A referendum would let the people decide what is in their best interests Additional Details  Government lockdowns have stolen the freedom of the nation The economy is destroyed  businesses are closing and people are losing their jobs The nations mental and physical health are suffering  and NHS services are not being fulfilled The true effects are yet to be felt and with the pandemic potentially lasting until late 2021  The people have to have a say on whether we want this to continue  and before any further measures are brought in Currently it is difficult for clinicians to authorise blood testing not in line with existing protocols for diagnosis  Funding should be used to examine the introduction of testing all blood markers for metabolism and possible causes driving the cancer Additional Details  In May 2019  I was diagnosed with GBM 4  If assessment had been done I would have been assessed as pre diabetic and hyperinsulimic  If this had been addressed  they could have treated or advised me  Instead I have researched and self funded an integrative pathway to correct these markers and extended my life expectancy by a considerable amount that others might not be able to do  There is little funding into brain tumours and treatment but there is clear evidence around the world to support metabolism has an effect  Advising on metabolism would most likely improve outcomes for many but it needs to be assessed at first point and needs to addressed alongside treatment  The Government should fund this specific area so that the NHS can revise current protocols in light of the evidence There are two major flaws with the current compulsory microchipping system  optional scanning and the lack of a single database  There are 13 microchip databases on the government list  independent commercial enterprises  different processes and no interest in creating a central standardised register!Additional Details  To confuse matters further  microchipping databases which do not meet government standards continue to trade  and often rank highly on search engines  If you register on an unlisted database  not only can you be fined £500 but your pet s microchip will read as unregistered when scanned The Government should introduce a single database of microchipped cats and dogs  and make it compulsory for chips to be checked at 1st veterinary appointment In Kashmir  the UN itself demanded such a vote but India after 72 years has always refused to allow the UN to mediate on this matter  This has led to endless conflict including two Indo Pakistani wars  hundreds of thousands of deaths  abuses and incarcerations Additional Details  A UN supervised plebiscite is their right!Many indigenous minorities within India have been denied their right to self determination but are attempting to initiate plebiscites e g  the Sikh Referendum 2020 India has now escalated the conflict by withdrawing Kashmir s special constitutional status  Article 370  and attempting to absorb the region as a  Union  territory Article below is a statement of Kashmir s Self Determination Struggle  https //www dawn com/news/1513347To ensure the Police and Crown Prosecution Service provide all victims of child sexual abuse with counselling and support before during and after trial  This is in gov legislation  but the CPS and Police still advise victims to the contrary in order to avoid contamination of evidence  This needs to end Additional Details  There is a moral duty for CPS and police to provide counselling to victims without fear it may affect their trial or justice  My brother Declan was raped by a paedophile  Before the trial my mum begged CPS  Police and Local Authority to provide support for her children but was told this would  contaminate court evidence  My brother took his own life at 13  His death could have been prevented  Declan s Law  would ensure future CSA victims get the support they deserve Bereaved parents who develop psychiatric illnesses are struggling to access timely mental health support  We urge the Government to fund specialist psychological support for bereaved parents  that is currently only available to mothers who have a living baby after child birth Additional Details  In September 2019 our baby daughter sadly died  We were informed by our perinatal team that because our baby died we were no longer under their remit  We have since been diagnosed as suffering from PTSD due to birth trauma  Maternity  perinatal and mental health services should not exclude bereaved parents who need access to good quality psychological support on the NHS Remove the restrictions of operating hours between 10pm and 5am for business such as bars  pubs  cinemas and restaurants  because Covid 19 can still be transmitted outside of these times Additional Details  How is it possible for the government to affect such a large amount of people s jobs by destroying the bar and pub industry  This won t stop transmission but will destroy these sectors  I propose that this restriction be lifted or local business affected be supported financially  Why can t we operate only between those hours 1  To amend Sections 88 and 89 of the Building Safety Bill so that leaseholders are not financially liable for building safety defects 2  To amend the limitation period for claims under S 1 Defective Premises Act 1972 to allow limitation to run 6 years from the date of discovery of the defectsAdditional Details  Following Grenfell  the Government have set aside £1bn for historical cladding defects  This is nowhere near enough to fix all buildings requiring remediation  Leaseholders have no legal protection against astronomical and life ruining costs incurred as a result of building safety failure  This is unacceptable  It should not fall to leaseholders to remedy the failure of building safety regulations in buildings they did not build  did not sign off as safe when it was not and don t even own The government must remove the threat of fines and further action and allow parental choice based on individual circumstances  Currently a blanket policy applies regardless of individual family risk levels from Covid 19  for example to those who are clinically vulnerable or single parent families  Additional Details  The UK Chief Medical Officers say school return is not risk free and that parents should “understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children ” But current policy does not give parents the right to do this  As well as the risk to children s health  the risk of harm to a child of losing a parent or having a parent incapacitated and unable to care for them is significant  Give parents the right to make decisions that are right for their child s circumstances Tell us how many people have died solely from Covid 19  without other health conditions  and without a 28 day period after a positive testAdditional Details  I would like the government to publish the statistics for how many people have died from coronavirus alone  and break it down into deaths by age bracket The Government should publish the false positive and negative test results data for PCR tests on Pillar 2 since the outbreak began  and include these results alongside the graphs and other data the government already publishes on our response to the Covid pandemic Additional Details  The data surrounding Pillar 2 testing is being used as the basis for imposing massive restrictions on liberty and society  Public scrutiny of this data must be facilitated For the most recent hunting season  Forestry England gave hunting licences for 34 fox and hare “trail hunts”  Despite hunting wild mammals with dogs being illegal  two of the licensed/previously licensed trail hunts have been associated with convictions under the Hunting and Animal Welfare Acts Additional Details  Other licensed fox hunts have recently been in the press for alleged trespass  killing foxes  losing control of their dogs and for another criminal conviction  A saboteur was severely injured at a hunt in early September that ordinarily receives a licence from Forestry England  It is only a matter of time before more convictions and more bans will have to be implemented  The answer is simple and effective – stop granting licences to hunts that are continuing to use the myth of ‘trail hunting  to chase and kill wildlife The government should be providing essential daily living services for those most vulnerable in society i e  those who are most susceptible to COVID  Provide services to allow them to shield  The government should re open our economy for the remainder of the population Additional Details  This would allow us to try and achieve herd immunity  with those most vulnerable still protected  Debt is rising with lockdowns  there are reported increases in mental health problems  addiction and domestic abuse  as well as a rise in cost of living and poverty  People need their personal freedoms restored  Most people with no underlying conditions will recover from COVID  The mental health of the country is on the line  Protect those who most need it and re open the rest of the country Football is a powerful tool of which allows a range of benefits such as employment  and other important aspects of life  Football can be associated with passion  emotion  excitement and dedication across the community  With Fans attending football games a range of economic benefits are there too Additional Details  Due to the current issues around COVID places such as France and Germany now allow a percentage of fans to return to football games  I ask for the support of this petition as I fear that smaller clubs in particular will go out of business leading to a devastating effect on people  This petition is to ask the government to reconsider their judgement on not letting football fans back into the stadiums and reconsider doing this with the right safety measures in place surrounding the COVID 19 I would like all staff members in mainstream schools to be trained on autism and how to cope with meltdowns  I would also like awareness on autism put through assembly s in school on a monthly basis to refresh children s minds that not all people are the same  Making this mandatory could save lives Additional Details  Having autism awareness spread is important to thousands of family s across the world and if schools knew more maybe the kids could be a bit better on school Alcohol sales in public houses are now restricted  by time  limit off sales from supermarkets to ensure vat revenues are maintained  public order is Maintained and the hospitality sector survives Additional Details  Parity  survival of the public house for future social interactions  community The wedding sector requires financial assistance due to the Government intervention during the Covid 19 pandemic  The government initially shut us down and has now imposed restrictions which has meant couples are either postponing or worse cancelling  and demanding refunds from businesses thatAdditional Details  are not fully open for business and have not been earning in 2020   Also Business Interruption Insurance is not paying out so we need 1  Compensation for loss of gross profit for 2020 and 2021 if restrictions continue2   Compensation to assist with refunds  especially as the CMA does not truly understand the wedding sectorThis is not limited to venues but all companies that provide services in the wedding sector from bloggers to videographers we all need this compensation We want our right as students to be able to attend school regardless of coronavirus  We should have the right to choose whether we wish to attend school or not  We shouldn t have to be told when not allowed to attend Additional Details  Because we have a right to our education  Online schools do not work at anywhere near the same efficiency  and if this is the only option then the GCSE and A Level courses should have content reduced and grade boundaries should be lowered The UK hospitality industry  Responsible for around 3m jobs  generating £130bn in activity  resulting in £38bn in taxation  Yet  unlike the Arts or Sports  we do not have a dedicated Minister We are asking that a Minister for Hospitality be created for the current  and successive governments Additional Details  A dedicated Minister would liaise with industry representatives  We believe such a Minister would have been beneficial to Government and Industry during the pandemic As the UK seeks to encourage investment and tourism back to the UK in coming years  the vision that UK hospitality industry portrays of the UK is excellence  innovation  inspiration  We need a Minister who can listen to concerns on taxation and legislation and bring forward suggestions to the chancellor and policy makers on our behalf
