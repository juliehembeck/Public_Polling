","Cervical screening needs to be every year.
 
This is because women are dying, mothers, wives, daughters, granddaughters and sisters are dying.
Additional Details: We need yearly checks regardless of the statistics.
 
It should be law that every women in England can access a yearly smear test. 
 
So they have a future.

Additional Details: My 87 year old father has just recovered from COVID-19 after 2 weeks in hospital. On Thursday 21st May he was hit from behind  by a reversing delivery van whilst taking a stroll in his quiet cul-de-sac in the retirement village where he lives. As a result of this I am setting up a campaign to make reversing cameras compulsory on vans and lorries.

Additional Details: As we have seen over the pandemic crisis, key workers are an essential part to our everyday lives.

Additional Details: HGV traffic is a direct indication on the health of a nation's economy. Providing drivers with adequate parking areas prevents conflict with those who disapprove of this vital industry, protects the welfare of the driver and improves road safety and the safety of the vehicle. It will encourage new blood to the industry.",closed,2020-05-27 20:54:01.000000,2021-02-05 00:00:08.000000,2020-08-04 13:23:04.000000,12393

This crime can change a persons life forever. I think the prison sentences and punishments for crimes like these as too soft and more needs to be done in terms of deterring this sort of crime.
Additional Details: We need to set an example. Child trafficking and child abuse goes on more than we think and we need to do more. The prison sentences abusers get is nothing compared to the lifelong trauma they inflict on their victims. I would like more funding to go to charities that help the victims of sexual abuse however I don’t think it’s enough. We need to set a standard. We need to protect our children and ourselves.

This includes restrictions on travel, social events, such as concerts or sports. No restrictions whatsoever.
Additional Details: You cannot force someone to have a vaccination, and should not be able to coerce them into it by way of restrictions.

Additional Details: The campaign is led by the British Alevi Federation and we believe the Government and ONS should listen carefully to the concerns raised. Data about minority groups is vital because underreporting could allow discrimination to go unnoticed. We ask the ONS to include a separate tick box in the next UK census in 2021 and to change the question as the same in Scotland and Northern Ireland to ‘What religion, religious denomination or body do you belong to?’.",closed,2020-05-28 19:41:07.000000,2021-02-07 00:00:08.000000,2020-08-06 09:07:49.000000,1238

How is this fair or legal? If the council aren't responsible for the upkeep of the area then surely the home owner and the landlords in that area should get a reduction in council tax fees.",closed,2020-05-30 11:32:43.000000,2021-02-07 00:00:08.000000,2020-08-06 14:20:33.000000,11488

Additional Details: One of the biggest barriers to electric vehicle(EV) adoption is the need to sign-up to several pre-payment apps in order to use the charging networks.

While the private sector is an important part of the EV networks future, their excessive range of RFID cards, apps and websites make their use frustrating.

Bathrooms and dormitories are single sex but staff are not always present; sexual assaults are not uncommon on mixed-sex wards. 
Additional Details: Mixed-sex wards can feel as if they lack privacy and at times can feel unsafe. Some patients have a history of abuse and trauma and need a single-sex environment to heal.

Additional Details: For the sake of the environment, the nation's health, to alleviate the burden on the NHS and for the sake of our economy we need to encourage more people to get on their bikes and to walk. By introducing legislation whereby the larger vehicle is presumed to be at fault in the event of an incident, drivers should be more inclined to show greater respect for other road users.",closed,2020-06-03 13:24:42.000000,2021-02-13 00:00:05.000000,2020-08-12 10:54:12.000000,5730

Schools closed their doors as part of the national effort to keep people safe but now face financial ruin.
Additional Details: The Chancellor announced that all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses in England - those most impacted by Covid-19 - would benefit from a business rates holiday for the next 12 months. However, due to some unclear guidance from the Ministry of Communities, Housing & Local Government, many English language schools are being deemed as ineligible by local authorities.

Police have unlimited time to investigate and respond to serious issues and take action. 28 days to fully respond to all complaints is achievable and would give the general public reassurance, instead of potentially having to wait years for a response.
Additional Details: People should be able to complain against police forces and receive a timely response, which should support continuous improvement by police forces. Assaults and mistreatment by police officers should be effectively responded to and dealt with as expeditiously as possible. I myself complained about being assaulted by the police and had to wait 3 years for video evidence of this police assault.

Recording a single path can take years, more time is needed to record them all, or they will be lost for ever.
Additional Details: Thousands of our historic Rights of Way, some used for centuries, are not officially mapped. If not recorded by 1st January 2026, they will be closed and lost forever. The legal process for recording a path, often done by volunteers, is time consuming and may take several years. There is not enough time left to record all our footpaths and bridleways.

I would like the government to give the BBL the requested 1 million pounds asked for by Sir Rodney Walker to survive the current situation.
Additional Details: I would like the government to fulfil the basketball community’s request as basketball has been proven to be one of the most popular sports by participation. According to Statista, Rugby League had 62,000 participants playing it in the UK whereas Basketball had 280,000 participating in the UK. Rugby League was given 15 million pounds, basketball was given nothing.

I believe you should be offered a smear test from the age of 16 as this is when you are legally allowed to be sexually active.",closed,2020-06-07 12:29:38.000000,2021-02-05 13:55:47.000000,2020-08-04 15:55:38.000000,61444

The Government should fund dedicated dementia wards in all hospitals, to provide advice, right environment, targeted medical treatment & comfort.
Additional Details: Dedicated wards would consist of nurses, doctors & other specialists who would be able to give the right treatment & assistance, in discussion with patients and carers.

19,Government,325653,Revoke Government support for large-scale new nuclear projects,"We petition the Government to revoke its support for large-scale nuclear power projects. They would be counter-productive to the UK's economic recovery, its climate targets and future national security.
Additional Details: Large nuclear projects are now too costly, however funded; too slow to construct, too fraught with technical obstacles and too controversial if run by overseas developers. Rather than contributing to a sustainable Green Recovery I worry they are draining funding, time and government attention from solutions that are much more deliverable and cost-effective.",open,2020-06-08 15:07:37.000000,2021-02-16 09:32:07.000000,2020-08-18 10:20:15.000000,3099

By the time students go back to normal learning, 6 months will have passed since schools were closed to most pupils. This has already had a huge impact on the studying of so many.
Additional Details: Students in the UK have already missed hundreds of hours of learning since 23rd March. This has had a huge effect. Some pupils don’t have the essential resources: a working computer, textbooks, stationary, etc. Many don’t have a proper learning environment, therefore results will most certainly not reflect the true efforts of pupils.

This will allow councils to pay these companies the grants and reduced business rates that they have been promised by the Chancellor.
Additional Details: The Chancellor said in the House of Commons that event hire & exhibition companies fell under the umbrella of leisure & hospitality and as such would qualify for the Retail, Leisure & Hospitality Grant. 

The guidance sent to local councils does not include them, and as such, they are being refused the support promised.

Now the median life expectancy for those living with cystic fibrosis is 37. This lack of an exemption needs to be revised.
Additional Details: Many people in the UK with cystic fibrosis have to pay prescription charges. I feel this is so wrong when a lot of others are exempt yet some with cystic fibrosis are expected to pay. Some people with CF have to take up to 11 different types of tablets a day, without antibiotics. Why should they be made to pay for prescriptions? We need to make this change.

Additional Details: Migrant domestic workers' visas are capped at six months and there is no way for them to renew them, leading many MDWs become undocumented after six months has elapsed. MDWs are already at a greater risk of experiencing forced labour and abuse, which only increases among those that are undocumented. The ability to renew the visa with a route to settlement will enable MDWs to seek support if their employer is abusive, and will enable them to continue to contribute to society.",open,2020-06-12 09:16:25.000000,2021-02-16 15:00:47.000000,2020-08-27 11:32:18.000000,12265

Additional Details: I do not agree that the vote on the Agricultural Bill was an accurate representation of the public's view; it would not be right to sell food in the UK that would be illegal to produce in the UK. I want all food that is sold in the UK to be from farms that have a minimum production and welfare standard.

Additional Details: To me, the damage & cost to public land, wildlife & nature at a time of Environmental emergency & recession outweighs the long-term benefits of travel.

There are many painless alternatives which makes this practice outdated. Please ban choke and pronged collars because their use can cause harm and is cruel and unnecessary punishment.
Additional Details: Choke and pronged collars can cause physical and emotional damage. Whiplash, puncturing the skin, spinal cord injuries and crushing the trachea are some examples. A dog, like a child, is totally dependent on it’s owner and their choices. Choosing to hurt the dog to correct it when there are other options must be considered inhumane.

We want an independent public inquiry into Grooming Gangs.
Additional Details: Last year we learned 57 young girls were thought to have been exploited by up to 100 members of a grooming gang. There is clear public concern, and appear to be failings by Police, Social Services, Local Authorities and the CPS to protect the most vulnerable.

- To remove the defense under s.76(8) where a perp can claim they were acting in the victim's best interest.
Additional Details: S.76 Serious Crime Act 2015 rightly recognises the horrific impact that coercive control has on victims of domestic abuse. 

However, it does not recognise that, for many victims, this abuse continues once they have left the abuser. 

Stalking and harassment law doesn't provide effective coverage - which often leaves victims without protection.

Living with a chronic condition is physically, mentally and emotionally draining. Knowing you have to take medication for the rest of your life is tough, but that medication doesn’t come free, or cheap.

The EWS1 form is designed to identify tall buildings where lives are at risk, but leaseholders in safe, modern, and even <18m buildings are left unable to sell or remortgage as lenders demand invasive surveys.
Additional Details: Three issues need resolving:
1) Lenders should not be able to require an EWS1 form for buildings that were never intended to need one. 

2) Building surveyors, rather than fire engineers, need to be insured to carry out surveys on low risk buildings, to help reduce the two-year backlog which is trapping residents. 

3) Requiring invasive surveys to establish new building safety is a Pandora’s box. Engineers, architects and builders must be compelled to produce evidence of safe construction.",open,2020-06-19 09:25:34.000000,2021-02-16 15:21:37.000000,2020-08-19 08:27:15.000000,33071

Additional Details: The Government has allowed leisure businesses to reopen from 4th July with social distancing requirements in place. Providing sports clubs can comply with the same requirements they should be allowed to reopen with limited capacities to allow them access to sources of income. Large scale protests have recently been held without emergency services being overwhelmed indicating the country is ready to start reopening the economy.

This should be a mixture of small tunnels for small mammals, invertebrates and amphibians, large tunnels for deer and badgers, and culverts for aquatic/semi-aquatic life.
Additional Details: Overground areas of HS2 pose a variety of threats to wildlife by blocking movement or causing direct mortality.

This could be done by the deceased's legal next of kin representing the deceased with legal documentation at the registration.
Additional Details: The law does not allow an unmarried mother to place the father's name on the child's birth certificate without them being present. When the father is deceased it is impossible to register them on the birth certificate without having to go through financial burdens, legal processes and added heartache.

Additional Details: The prejudice and superstition that surrounds the over 53,000 Pagans in England today is very sad to witness. Many families have been practicing Paganism for generations, it is a long misunderstood faith that centers its beliefs in the natural world and doing only good.

His killer was sentenced to 3 years for Causing Death by Careless Driving and is eligible for release from prison in 18 months. We want appropriate justice. Appropriate justice is a life sentence for these crimes.
Additional Details: Kristian's killer was convicted of causing death by 'Careless Driving' rather than 'Dangerous Driving' - a crime which carries a maximum sentence of just 5 years. 18 months in prison is not justice for killing someone and is unlikely to deter future drink-driving. The sentence does not fit the crime. The impact to the lives of the victim’s family is incomprehensible and a sentence of 18 months further damages the family.

Additional Details: Dated July 2020, The MHCLG published it summary of consultations and the governments`s response. Primary legislation does not include a power to prevent site owners from passing on annual or application fees to park home residents via the pitch fee. These costs should be borne by the industry  or by central government, where its predecessors failed to to ensure that rogue and criminal park owners were not afforded licenses and therefore facilitated their expansion.

This excludes those that act for sexual gratification, financial gain, or to humiliate the victim (or those who are indifferent). Distress and embarrassment regardless of intent must be included to fill this gap.
Additional Details: The current legislation fails to protect those who have their intimate images shared without consent or knowledge because the intention was sexual and depraved as opposed to malice towards the individual. The criteria of the offence is half complete as consent is distinct but intentions are ambiguous. My private images were shared without consent during a seemingly trusting relationship.

This should help tackle sexism and increase participation.
Additional Details: Many students are made to feel out of place in school sport, and cannot express their true selves when forced to do a sport just because of their gender. It also causes inequality as from day one students are defined by their gender, which can knock some people’s self-confidence.

Additional Details: As the UK is a major investor and beneficiary of the natural resources of Azerbaijan and an influential member in global politics, it has the ability to highlight the current dangerous escalation of violence and military action in the region.

Additional Details: Given that the government failed to investigate possible interference in the referendum when there seemed to be evidence of potential interference on electoral and democratic events, it doesn't feel as though they have the country's best interest at heart.

Additional Details: Currently leaseholders are living in homes/flats which are unsafe, unsellable, and face paying for something which was not their fault.

Additional Details: We believe the proposals from Highways England for Junction 10 of the A3/M25 are flawed because an Alternative has not been considered, and that the DCOs scheme unnecessarily threatens the environment including the future of RHS Garden Wisley. The proposals would put the RHS under huge financial burden; the increased journey time to the Garden could lose the RHS £6.6m during the construction period & lead to a loss of £19.2m over 10-years.

Additional Details: Breast cancer does not only affect women over 50, it affects many women in their 20s, 30s and 40s and they aren’t offered screening unless there is a family history or an abnormality that they must find themselves. Men can also be affected by breast cancer so are equally entitled to screenings.

Additional Details: We believe including calorie counts on restaurant menus would be at the extreme mental and physical detriment of those suffering from eating disorders, which research suggests is somewhere between 1.25 and 3.4 million people in the UK alone. Calorie counts can promote food being seen as a ""reward"" that is ""earned"", which can encourage excessive exercise and potential binging/purging behaviours.

Also for gyms to not be put in the same group as pubs in terms of risk or importance. Gyms are following strict guidelines and most members are following rules in a sober manner.
Additional Details: The gyms are a huge benefit for users, not just physically but mentally too. There are studies that show physical exercise can be a great boost to the immune system and releases endorphins which can prevent stress and a chain of mental illnesses. In such a stressful time people need a viable way to exercise.

In Canada, for example, ANY contact for a sexual purpose between a person and an animal can be a criminal offence. The Government should recognise the weakness in the current law and change it.
Additional Details: Bestiality can be an indicator crime, and many offenders transfer the violence from animals to people.

Additional Details: We believe the Public Interest Disclosure Act fails to protect whistleblowers, the public and the public purse. It doesn't compel protection, nor ensure investigation of disclosures or correction of wrongdoing. It doesn’t prevent cover ups, and gives inadequate redress after serious, irreparable harm, and can lead to wasteful, destructive litigation. Only 3% of cases succeed at hearing.

Additional Details: Following the IB and the SQA results, we have seen evidence that due to the new grading procedure, individuals have not received grades they feel are consistent with their work over the last two years. 

Without any appeals process, students in England could be forced to reapply for university/college or defer their entry - even if they have evidence that they feel goes against the grades they received.

Additional Details: Many dog owners do not know the risks of rawhide products for their pets and due to this many have had their lives crushed by the devastating impact that it can have. Blockages, choking and contamination are all risks associated with rawhide, while some fight through, others aren’t as lucky.

These changes will reduce the 50% duty threshold from 5,000hl to 2,100hl: small breweries will have to pay more duty, whilst larger breweries could pay the same or less.
Additional Details: Those that will have to pay more do not know by how much as the consultation has been delayed until the Autumn. This is creating grave uncertainty for many small breweries at a time when the industry is trying to survive the Covid-19 crisis.

We believe the Treasury should not reduce relief for any brewers below 5,000hl and should reverse its decision to reduce the threshold to 2,100hl, and that these changes are threatening closures, innovation, competition, local jobs, investment and consumer choice.",closed,2020-08-06 17:01:56.000000,2021-02-11 00:00:05.000000,2020-08-10 07:20:49.000000,51609

The general public may make video recordings of police and publish them immediately, our police forces should have the same right.

A process needs to be introduced whereby UK police forces may take the decision to release unedited body cam footage of an incident to both Mass Media outlets, and their own Social Media.

Additional Details: Final grades have been determined on the area in which a student resides, meaning many have been downgraded unfairly, even in this stressful situation.

Additional Details: To make a claim against the manufacturer under the Consumer Protection Act you have to be within 3 years of knowing or that there was a problem with the medical device. Although this limit can be extended at the discretion of the court, there's a maximum of 10 years from when a particular device was manufactured. 

Some don't find out their problems are attributable to the device until many years down the line, after being investigated for other medical conditions that they simply do not have. Ladies have lost families, homes and jobs, all destroyed by a device they had been led to believe to be safe.

In 2018 alone, 726 people died while homeless. Yet councils respond to this by erecting anti-homeless architecture around the country. This is unethical.

Additional Details: Whilst many industries are now able to trade either fully or partially, the travel industry is being disproportionately affected by travel restrictions and quarantines being imposed by the government.

In Australia, tenants can be evicted for being 14 days in arrears with rent. Lets have that system here.
Additional Details: The current system is unfair to Landlords. If a Tenant doesn't pay rent then it can take a year for Landlord to regain procession. In that time the Landlord still has to pay mortgage and other costs. This can ruin many small scale Landlords.

The movement for low impact and sustainable dwellings, like those allowed by the Welsh one planet development policy and Scottish Crofting Commission are helping to reduce both of these issues.

Additional Details: The theatre industry is benefiting from the culture bail-out but that sum cannot do more than help some venues and organisations survive the current closure.

It should not fall to leaseholders to remedy the failure of building safety regulations in buildings they did not build, did not sign off as safe when it was not & don’t even own.",open,2020-09-18 19:30:40.000000,2021-02-16 14:07:57.000000,2020-10-13 09:06:40.000000,6162
190,Education,551740,Suspend fines for school non-attendance during Covid-19 & allow parental choice,"The government must remove the threat of fines and further action and allow parental choice based on individual circumstances. Currently a blanket policy applies regardless of individual family risk levels from Covid-19 (for example to those who are clinically vulnerable or single parent families).
Additional Details: The UK Chief Medical Officers say school return is not risk-free and that parents should “understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children.” But current policy does not give parents the right to do this. As well as the risk to children's health, the risk of harm to a child of losing a parent or having a parent incapacitated and unable to care for them is significant. Give parents the right to make decisions that are right for their child’s circumstances.",open,2020-09-19 12:44:48.000000,2021-02-16 12:31:17.000000,2020-10-06 12:26:45.000000,6707

192,Health,552013,Publish false positive and negative Covid-19 test data for Pillar 2,"The Government should publish the false positive and negative test results data for PCR tests on Pillar 2 since the outbreak began, and include these results alongside the graphs and other data the government already publishes on our response to the Covid pandemic.
Additional Details: The data surrounding Pillar 2 testing is being used as the basis for imposing massive restrictions on liberty and society. Public scrutiny of this data must be facilitated.",open,2020-09-22 10:41:49.000000,2021-02-16 12:58:37.000000,2020-10-01 15:55:36.000000,11065
193,Animals,552017,Stop Forestry England granting licenses for Fox & Hare hunts,"For the most recent hunting season, Forestry England gave hunting licences for 34 fox & hare “trail hunts”. Despite hunting wild mammals with dogs being illegal, two of the licensed/previously licensed trail hunts have been associated with convictions under the Hunting and Animal Welfare Acts.
Additional Details: Other licensed fox hunts have recently been in the press for alleged trespass, killing foxes, losing control of their dogs & for another criminal conviction. A saboteur was severely injured at a hunt in early September that ordinarily receives a licence from Forestry England. 

It is only a matter of time before more convictions and more bans will have to be implemented. The answer is simple and effective – stop granting licences to hunts that are continuing to use the myth of ‘trail hunting’ to chase and kill wildlife.",open,2020-09-22 11:23:38.000000,2021-02-16 15:46:07.000000,2020-10-06 08:21:17.000000,69952

Provide services to allow them to shield. The government should re-open our economy for the remainder of the population.
Additional Details: This would allow us to try and achieve herd immunity, with those most vulnerable still protected. Debt is rising with lockdowns, there are reported increases in mental health problems, addiction and domestic abuse, as well as a rise in cost of living & poverty. People need their personal freedoms restored. Most people with no underlying conditions will recover from COVID. The mental health of the country is on the line.

Football can be associated with passion, emotion, excitement and dedication across the community. With Fans attending football games a range of economic benefits are there too.
Additional Details: Due to the current issues around COVID places such as France and Germany now allow a percentage of fans to return to football games. I ask for the support of this petition as I fear that smaller clubs in particular will go out of business leading to a devastating effect on people. This petition is to ask the government to reconsider their judgement on not letting football fans back into the stadiums and reconsider doing this with the right safety measures in place surrounding the COVID-19.",open,2020-09-22 13:04:56.000000,2021-02-16 14:27:57.000000,2020-09-29 16:36:22.000000,200389

Making this mandatory could save lives.
Additional Details: Having autism awareness spread is important to thousands of family’s across the world and if schools knew more maybe the kids could be a bit better on school.",open,2020-09-22 15:33:17.000000,2021-02-16 10:56:47.000000,2020-10-19 10:15:19.000000,11928

The government initially shut us down and has now imposed restrictions which has meant couples are either postponing or worse cancelling  and demanding refunds from businesses that
Additional Details: are not fully open for business and have not been earning in 2020.  

Also Business Interruption Insurance is not paying out so we need:

1- Compensation for loss of gross profit for 2020 and 2021 if restrictions continue
2 - Compensation to assist with refunds, especially as the CMA does not truly understand the wedding sector

This is not limited to venues but all companies that provide services in the wedding sector from bloggers to videographers we all need this compensation.",open,2020-09-23 10:41:17.000000,2021-02-16 14:29:07.000000,2020-10-16 13:50:46.000000,3737

We are asking that a Minister for Hospitality be created for the current, and successive governments.
Additional Details: A dedicated Minister would liaise with industry representatives. We believe such a Minister would have been beneficial to Government & Industry during the pandemic.

As the UK seeks to encourage investment & tourism back to the UK in coming years, the vision that UK hospitality industry portrays of the UK is excellence, innovation, inspiration. 

We need a Minister who can listen to concerns on taxation & legislation and bring forward suggestions to the chancellor and policy makers on our behalf.",open,2020-09-23 15:28:38.000000,2021-02-16 15:30:17.000000,2020-10-06 11:22:31.000000,209484
